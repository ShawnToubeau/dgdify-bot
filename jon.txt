What are we to ever do, my mind is lead and you're a wall
The lion's den of I'm akin, to sleeping late and eating wrong
Well If I ever got it straight, I think I'd bend at every pause
The action leaking out my face, from breathing paint to missing calls
Well I'm the sugar-coated tooth, and I have come to ruin your mood
While staring at the frozen foot, I realized I'm stupid too
Well Farming isn't fun at all, and I will build a thousand malls
And eat the food courts flesh, from every single city
Shave it out, you need a break from hair
Coming out bald, I'm the eagle in the air
With the big ass braids and the folding chair
Just shave it out, you need a break from hair
Set it up, cover the plans, record everyone, make demands
Positional strategy, split was disastrous, flanking the siege
Bit by bit I recover from this
Cleanse my palette and validate my gifts
Little by little, remove myself from the middle
Stick to the man till they bones is brittle, aware?

Back to sloth and sleeping binges
Self defeating outburst, cringes
Thoughts get rusty, creaky hinges
Lost that box of clean syringes
Stuck to the ceiling I'm in view
Can't shake the notion I'm becoming you
The look from above same as below
Sign up for high, free dose of low
The Jig is up, I'm the one
Manipulate the ones I love
Light my path, reveal the beacon
Where's my balance
Can't stop thinking
Can't stop thinking
Can't stop thinking
Stop
Searching for substance
Waiting for the impulse
Your thoughts intangible
Around the winding road
Sinus pressure getting older
I like weight upon my shoulders
Here I live inside this CD
Tell your friends he's super creepy
Weirded out a simple human
Confused by words arrange and move them
Into spaces apparent meaning
Eat this song your ears are greedy
I can turn it off again, I can smile on a whim
I can make believe in him, the function in the algorithm
I can turn it off again, I can smile on a whim
I can make believe in him, the function in the algorithm

Who drains the blood from my head? (I do, I do)
Who comes through with the meds? (I do, I do)
Blackened seeds you're gonna needs these, freeze
The common ancestor
The pressure of industry
Who sleeps in the grease crease
Wax and trails of mutual deceit
I heard that growth was gettin weak
Who taps the line, records my mind
Twisted agenda, align my spine
Whose got the steeples, the people and scepters, the rocks on the beaches, the angles the vectors
Who drains the blood from my head? (I do, I do)
And who accepts me as I am? (I do, I do)
The crack on the staircase, I smoked out of boredom
My kitchen is filled with meat and chloroform
Squirming colors metastasize
Upon viewing the world the fetus eats its own eyes
Acting the fiction and signing the right away
Transistor electrocute, wiping the order away
Awkward offensive hold, perfectly natural
They can't speak 'bout my brand because I'm dead and white

This is my brand, and I charge you the fee
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
I jumped inside the blender, now drink me
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
Rage against the reflection
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
Buy this shit stained product infection
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
Wax and wane, and wax and wane, I wanna soak up the glory
Wax and wane, and wax and wane, I wanna soak up the glory
Yeah turn on my right hand
Yeah turn on my right hand
You know the price ain't right
And if I spin this hype, then I'm award winning actor man
Yeah turn on my right hand
Push with your clout, pull the mud out your mouth man
I'm only christening what's mine
You come back once and then the second time for blood
That's my trope, and my sleight of hand
I'm about to predict the future
Any credit given will be swept under the rug
Or reduced to the fine print
I'm only silent when you're asking questions
The simple answer is "no I wasn't present"
All I see is an ocean of replicas
All I see in their eyes is my reflection

What I had in mind was
What you held against me
Never satisfied
Or just never coming back
No, prep him for the ghost
Let him see the ghost
Let it in and come to terms with what would have, could have been
Prep him for the weight
Let him see the fate
Fracturing relationships
And isolation
What I had in mind was
What you held against me
Before you decide that this is dated
Take me out of the equation
What was it that you most hated?
All the time that you spent waiting
When the stomach becomes the mouth and its spewing all its garbage out
To think before speaking would prevent you from the point you're making
When the stomach becomes the mouth and its spewing all its garbage out
To think before speaking would prevent you from the point you're making
The slew of trails towards destiny, the perfect day to quit
The slew of trails in reverie, bite my crooked shape
Got a box of lies
Gonna get you high with the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book
And I'm not a crook
But ill take your guilt in the form of dollars
Got a box of lies
Gonna get you high with the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book
And I'm not a crook
But ill take your guilt in the form of dollars
Its all that
Its all that
Never fold under pressure
Never mind how I got there

Be your rock, I'll be your guide
Without you it's suicide
Until then I'll watch you sleep
I'm just tying the knot
I'm just tying the knot
I've got the sickest picture of you in my mind
I get the strangest urges all of the time inside
Take part in this demonstration, rope mixed with wine
I hope to follow through with you cause the timings right
Stuck inside the living room
Tangled faces, glow in tune
I can't monitor what I consume
Slap your wrist, accept the sentence

Put it in my fist and squish n twist with the wrist
Hotter than my
That's my body, it's a device
Turn on the anti rape mechanism
Porcelain shooters, walk past the moon
Macroscopic view
Piece together, shards into cables
Swollen shoulder rotator cuff
Clandestine, makeshift vestibule
Pardon the unstable broken stuff
I did college, majored in smart, concocted ways to be useless and poor
Successful could barely describe the shape of my infinite wisdom, I can spit from mouth
The esoteric, righteous believer, repeat the process, becoming a monk
The morality was it derived from or intrinsically inherent
Cold blocks pop, concocts an instant freeze
I'm consistently drawn to the smell of please
Flooded brain tips I'm seeing shapes like trees
Turn it on its side and rape the vertices
Ripple lifter christening his new bought bricks
Grip my magic, force the page to slip
Rope burn mistress in the cage with a limp
Turn it on its side and smack the weak out the wimp
For slump
Get it away from me
Get it away from me
Empty it out
Empty it out

His self-repairing skeleton
Cyborg man's computer blood
Programming immunity
Alpha being
His knowledge expands exponentially
As he rapidly evolves at infinitum
Deleting disease, cut and sever
Cells and metal blend together
Replicating, assimilating, science and biology
The death of the robot, the birth of him
All at once we'll become him
The death of the robot, the birth of him
One by one we'll become him
In future utopias, alpha hybrids evolve
Into progressive societies, worship efficiency
Technology makes me pray to logic
And science makes us strong
We rape the ignorance of man
Prepare the arrival
Right on time
He arrives
Alleviate the symptoms from
A toxic society
We praise the future

I'm sick of twisting the knobs, your little baby's a slob
I wanna love you but this house ain't built for two
I think I panic a lot, not really sure what I've got
I wanna love you but this house ain't built for two
I'm sick of twisting the knobs
I think I've hidden from myself, but there's too many layers
I turn my head and cough
Like I'm calling the cops
Is there something more to you than just bible study?
To my sunstroke ghost dance gold corona
Did I crack that lens, put my weight upon ya
Does the manifest dictate to love and honor
Can the creed uphold, can we repeat our mantra

Trust my luck and show my feelings
Cross my fingers, cards are dealing
Busting out my skull shaped ceiling
Hold my fucking body back
I'm still raging from the sanction you placed upon the impoverished nations
Delusions of grandeur, have some patience
Hold my fucking body back

Shimmy my way down underground, polluting airways in my wake
Swaying architecture, grappling a birthday cake
It's analogy backfire, in the cliché storm of backwards prose
Shoot the agony beam
Wearing sacrificial clothes
Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to hear what you're seeing
Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to know what you're feeling
If it's making sense on time, then why do I hear their whines?
If it's moves and breathes it's fine, don't let it mess with your mind
Paging Dr. Mess your patient's throwing food and ate his robe
Quantum something can do anything
An accidental public confession was made
I was in a viper fight, but I'm alright
Confused cause I'm too dumb to find the light
Carcinogenic isotope, we need the A-team montage
Disregard the message from the ending of the album

Stomp that feeling; your puke is a mutant
Can’t think of who did this, well I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it’s admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger
Separate is the way though, no second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your god
See you in battle; your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business; your plaque on my wall
You’ll forget I’m wrong
Do it again, do it again, do it again, now grow
I run quickly out of air, by the way I hate your celebration
I run quickly out of air, by the way I hate our aging faces

It’s so relieving to show my ray
Beam of belief in identity
It’s not deceiving to be this way
I came to show you my sack
The things that you do with your attitude
I’m awkward, I’m chipper, I’m random dude
The picture, I like it, so don’t be rude
We all came here just to fap
Only I share with the lesson, I’m mocking it
Letting the pear flip its shape
Top of the tumor its rumored I’m neutered
A fabulous rape in the taint
Expecting the people to live in your head
If you knew what to do, then you’d do what you said
Proxy the awesome and seek the deletion of reaper repeating submission face
Opt for the option to stop this exhaustion and breathe through the tube of civility
The end is, the end is, the end is, the end of days
I have something important too

Stuff that big, bottomless cup in my hand
Fill up this riddled with curses, old man
Acting like enemies out of my way
Still won't break up with the things I have made
Nah, I don't do that anymore
No people, just places I adore
Too bad I lost the feeling
Leave it alone I'm asleep so I'm healing
All great things have battle scars
You wanna swap this belief with a greater art
My flesh road has only grown into a mattress fit for mounting
I've faced this allergy. It won't go away
Upgraded salary, employment virus aid
I've faced this allergy. It's everything I thought that I could fake
I see me riding off, off through the clouds
I see me riding off, off to the bitter end
I see me riding off, off through the clouds
I see me writing off, off all my bitter ends

Pop that, shock and awe, get that grab it, go go claws
I go broke when I assume I suck
Flex my settlement, I’m selling stuff
Get that, go in raw, have a baby, adopt a dog
Well I blasted enacted and off to space
Well I practiced adapted, and it felt great
Legs don’t matter, they’re just softening, I’m limping
Bugs don’t matter, no death is suffering, just squish it
Legs don’t matter, they’re just softening, I’m limping
Bugs don’t matter, no death is suffering, just squish it

Why can't I seem to find my mind?
The time is almost up
It's wide, I'm fried, and died inside
It's deep and broken up
Host of the feelings left, isn't there
Ran outside to waste his cares if had done faster, then I'm spared to sleep instead of suck
Maybe it's time to quit the game. It wasn't me. The world is drunk
I'm a piston on a mission, pumping out my guts
She said I was something like a filler in her molar
A hibernating Siamese twin on her shoulder
I lose my shit enough, I bite a bit off more than I can chew
You collected fashion tips and now I wear a cage
Stuck in a batters grip, faking a limp
Happy to cry, waiting for gifts, biding my time
I injected apathy attempt to disengage
Avoiding those parroting...They won't decide a, they won't decide a, they won't decide a, they won't decide a thing
I'm so sick in the brain, I don't even practice keeping in touch
Throw my thoughts in the drain
The clutch of abraxas stone, torn deep through the rug
Watch my drippin bone erupt, as I bellow the message, complete with the flood, when the hot fog rolls on a match and sparks it up
Ribbon lip quiver, God callin' when I've had enough
I'm lost
If had done faster, then I'm spared to sleep instead of suck
Maybe it's time to quit the game
It wasn't me
The world is drunk

The belief is a burden and a crop
Now the dream is only a memory
Cry, mine is mine, I clamp my head in the crease
Of a familiar smell
I think the tree is a thief
I'm fryin' everything that incubate and ever was
Simmer fifteen rips before I croak and die
I flipped that maggot out
I sniffed that dragon's brew
I say I'm feelin' when everyone is on my side
We think we're relevant
Hey, we think we're being admired
It's slipping into this
All of you, all the heads inside the hole of cause
We're getting intimate
It's a flu, in a vein
How do we disconnect from the arm?

Talk about your feelings
I'm goin pitch black
Talk about my feelings
I don't wanna, fuck that
It don't believe me I mustn't whip that
Soft as the pillow is, ship this shit back
Stand up and notify the registry
I'm buying a house in a shit storm economy
Make love, I plagiarized the books I read
My infinite wisdom, belligerent at lightning speed
I'll go get the decider
I'll be the center divider
I could be more than just "Hey bro, listen."
I'll be claiming you flaggin
I'll be braggin I'm admin
I could fulfill the people's crave for pigskin
Who am I kidding?
Who am I kidding?
Small world syndrome, I can hear your criticism, buh- buh- bouncing off the base of my buttons
You bluffin
I could go get the biggest brick so you could break in
I could constrict the citizen to make a payment

To condone this great offense, I address the audience
Our grip is strong or impotent
We're wise to hype this up
Call on the creed and prophesize you'd witness this event
The infant's egg is monetized, a privilege heaven sent
Under the spell of it, we're wise to hype this up
A new former shell of it, I'm wise to hype this up

It’s that one type of night with the bright white ice pick
Slipped up signature, wrestle till I scribble shit
Who in my space smell khaki leather pants?
If my brain go missin, I’ll be damned
The one ripped by the wind
Instant implant
How we see what we thought was nothing before
Now the lost and the waste can slide beside them
Perform the custom of hissing lisp adorn
I know them and I know what
I think I’m a start this up
Like the fastest object overgrowth, like a basket lobbin egg and yolk, I got the bombest little habit
Watch my head explode like the plant lion synthesized this shit

Please make way for the special invented armor
Mental protection if reality is raging harder
Hello, Mister Mime; hello, Medicine
I believe denial makes me hella intelligent
I know we trust each other; don’t fail the litmus
We all need partners for the pain of existence
My bedroom chemistry set ended up on your Pinterest
Pledging allegiance to a few common interests
Claw my way to the top of the centipede
The sum of its parts is prescribing me symmetry
Every bone picked and decision was orchestrated
Cut the head off and the legs’ll call the action complacent

Death murders everything in sight
Beneath the rip in the wind, the pillar push you aside
If I make way, I can taste your sigh
Just like the cannibal amp, it knows sound is size
“Push me to the brink,” I said
Well that bitch is a creep, it tried to know what I think
To breathe out passion, or suck in fate
You think the world was made to wield your weight and bleed out?
Mirin myself all by myself
Feel the caress so sweet, done by my hand
Polishing this frame of mind, jacked it up an ax to grind
Duck ‘n dodge, stay unaligned
My recognition face
Some get withered, some get fried
I know we talked about the shit we did each time
Polishing this frame of mind, jacked it up an ax to grind
Duck ‘n dodge, stay unaligned
My recognition face

I am lost
Need a God
I am blind
Give me eyes
I conceive a better way to lie
The witnesses evaded
Everywhere I look I feel the weight
So wait it out now
I know a guy
Somewhere
Whose got a guy
From town
Who knows a guy
From around
Whose gotta die
I called my sister’s cousin, uncle, friend, made sure to trust them time and time again
The group is never ending
The group grew from decay
The group is darkness, father
Heaven selected the truth as pain
