How, how could we forget about you
The summoner, the centerfold, successor to the brood
Of all the iterations yeah you're the sickest dude
Fighting cow, how could we forget about you
Show up at the ball wit yo doo doo faced babe
The robot with human hair is dead but gets laid
That’s why he’s got all these kids on the way
His son’s a girl named baby swirl that loves to swang his blade
Brontosaurs fear of art is torn apart by making
Good mistakes and branching out he switch it up like baking
The more I tried to sleep it off the more I started thinking
I wanna live in mushroom park, do unrestricted shrinking
Made up magic turtle guy is feeling like he’s crap
He needs to spend some time alone to understand his path
There's different types of waves and things your mind is tuning to
It takes in information and it sorts it out for you

I'm kissing a baby that licking a boot
I live in a deli put meat on your tooth
My business is pregnant and flaunting off nude
I'm smoking a chicken I took out the coupe
Show off addictions and make it sound fiction
You aren't doing art if you're dead in the park
If you feel like you died show 'em you have
Give up your life for the virtual clap
Shear off the weird and then watch 'em appear
Now you’re a spiritless fearless lil lyricist
Shear off the weird and then watch 'em appear
Now you're a spiritless, fearless lil lyricist
Hoax
There is no operation
Doctor Mess goes flagrant
Till' he makes you leggo yo eggo
They schemin', bottom-feeding
Robbin' them cribs
Don't let those veterinarians
Close to your kids
Don't fight, it's too magnetic
Did dis dude just did dis?
Space blood done made you an addict
Now I done gone through these body bags
Let's make this dinner a classic
Cook up some breakfast and bounce
I remember you back in the day
Prodigy show 2003
We were camping out in Jnco jeans
The ecstasy was super clean
I never wanted to be caught up in not looking back
I never wanted to be treated like a psycho
I couldn't face another second of your vacant threats
I couldn't shuffle through the pieces of my costume
Look the other way
Always been my game
Come up in my closet I'ma get you fat
That's a chill initial feeling when I come right back
I can see the orchids blooming out your beautiful crack
Since my head is now my belly I need big brain snacks
Welcome to my odd ass city with the lopsided loaves
The limp wristed winded sex on abdomen
What's my style I'm blind to dude tooth clang
Chomp real loud I tuned out all intervals
Looking through the glass watching eyes cry glitter
Slid in on a sack laced in body suit slipper
I'ma peel in two and then shed my image
Turn into some panoramic spinning gold bridges
Cah Shwink
I got a sudden itch
They're gonna raise my rent
I'm gonna run around, let people know I don't need this
 want to, I'd like to, I'm gonna file, yeah
March around, through the town, It's all goin' down, wow
Been a little while since we played as kids
I found it impressive the way you worked those wooden limbs
But she's amazing for every occasion
I want a lot more of your mom around
I'm sad she's gone and couldn't have more time
To notice all the ways her bright ass shines
But he's impatient. Creeps on Brayden
No one really likes your dad around
Now that's winter's over and you got an apartment
I think about the times when we shaved our armpits
And she was gracious
Knew we were wasted
I wish we had more of your mom around
The big city life is getting busy and hectic
We should reconnect and have sex in my Lexus
And he was racist
Except for Asians
And no one really likes your dad around
Eye yai yai yai yai
I'm stuffed
Eye yai yai yai yai
Nice pup
Eye yai, Eye yai
Eye yai, Eye yai
Eye yai yai yai
I'll never replay yuh

Wore out my wheels while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeals hear the seal bout to break
Wore out my wheels while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeals, hear the seal bout to break

Retired is a word that I hate
I go quiet 'cause I know how to think
Skunk pliers are the tools of the dank
Young friar is my new chicken drank
Why you try and go and touch people
Eight hundred sixty seven bald eagles
Why you try and go and touch people
Eight hundred sixty seven red beetles
Asses, asses, asses in battle
Die die die die die ya bad apples
Asses, asses, asses in battle
Use your face like a dumbass rattle

My accent my glibness. A bee dipped in brass
I'm stuck on the isthmus connecting my past
A passionate servant when I'm paid in cash
Don't ask if it's worth it. Don't think bout the math

There's no complaining in the mansion
You can't just do what I do
I chuck my brain through the black
Climb up the tree
Shoot out the cannon
Fuck her cause she reads
Punctuation violation perpetrator is verified
Hi hi hi hi
Flunked out and flung from the front of your face wait
I smell Sharon's pimple, it's the size of grapes
I'm so splintered that my mind waved back
I had cash but sold it for some soul I'm da wraith
The brightest of wizards I bit her and love came on gushing out
Guzzled some lizards my skin turned to scale. Felt it wrap around
Payments get vicious. Account gettin' roasted and flayed
I started a party, and partied, and partied, and flew away
What a feeling when I'm feeling the feel for real
I'm over woke and flippin' a table
I shed a tear and then appear in the mirror
Still here, but blasted out through pineal cable
Same vein but different textures
I'm finna whip my hip out my frame
Twist bone that hooks through the braid
Loops lonely needs a twin action
Fast enough to flip back the attraction
I can see it and it's audibly wobbly
Tastes just like a can of broccoli
Fishin' hook like slimy apostrophe
One letter missing 'tween two monstrosities
Oh...Blast!
Cut after cut of liquid energy
Beams are buffed and I'm like 'yay'
Back in the beast, hate this impulse slave
Close it up and then ride the wave
I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
Snake round the wheel, now I know what I've known
I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
All wrapped up and ravin' and rolled through the snow, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
Don't act like you know me
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
It's under control
I see the glass half poured
And then I pee inside the pitcher
I wanna wet the bed
'Cause it reminds me I'm a swimmer
And when I feel like Greg
Then I remind me that I'm Jon (Hi Jon!)
I like to make a mess
And then shit on every song
We're at the end of the mission, no need for decisions
I jump off a cliff, I like this
We're at the end of the mission, no need for decisions
I fall in a ditch, I like this
You don't need a baby
You need to go crazy
You need to meet god

Put it in a painting
A picture of it raining, a symbol of us

Double double dare
You pissed off your parents
Now your car

Gonna take care
It's yours, not our hair
And so we have fun
Hack, slash, braid and cut
Twist, curl and tease the tuft
Blow it out and spray the stuff
Slick it back and fluff it up
Hair song
It's a great one to get ready to
Have your friend do your make up fool
Catch up with a dear loved one
You can make it hard or you can make it fun
If you need some company
You should meet these obligations
What's responsibility
It ain't permanent vacations
Yeah you think you give a great hug
No, Yeah you think you give a great hug
No, yeah you squish your little face smug
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Yeah you got your validation huh? 
Yeah, be your own patient
Oh, Yeah you got your validation huh?  
Yeah you squish your little face smug
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Check your ballot and vote this dick, right?
You gotta eat, right?
You gotta eat, right?
I'm not looking down and then looking away
I'mma cook a brat like I cook a filet
Nobody out here has been talking to Dave
Will ain't even liking what you had to say

Do you even love her?
Do you even love her?
Thats your own mother!
Bloodsucker
I figure that was another ass hard ass part
My coke's inside this bloodied rag
I'm in a stats class smoking backpack pie chart
With a grove of muddy greaser bees
You gotta be on alcohol
To hang out in a shopping mall
There's nothing left to buy that isn't cheaper online
The only reason I'm alive is
Waiting for the A.I. to do some tight shit
And lemme suck its fucking dick
She like it puffy, comfy and lumpy
Make your ass a frumpy dumpy bro
Squawk, seven-five
Zero zero mane
World in a barrel dripping some blood
Three dead riders
Grippin' the reigns of saturn
In da last plastic cup
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
I feel like I'm gonna stay
I feel like I'm gonna change
I feel like I'm gonna stay
