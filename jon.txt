What are we to ever do, my mind is lead and you're a wall
The lion's den of I'm akin, to sleeping late and eating wrong
Well If I ever got it straight, I think I'd bend at every pause
The action leaking out my face, from breathing paint to missing calls
Well I'm the sugar-coated tooth, and I have come to ruin your mood
While staring at the frozen foot, I realized I'm stupid too
Well Farming isn't fun at all, and I will build a thousand malls
And eat the food courts flesh, from every single city
Shave it out, you need a break from hair
Coming out bald, I'm the eagle in the air
With the big ass braids and the folding chair
Just shave it out, you need a break from hair
Set it up, cover the plans, record everyone, make demands
Positional strategy, split was disastrous, flanking the siege
Bit by bit I recover from this
Cleanse my palette and validate my gifts
Little by little, remove myself from the middle
Stick to the man till they bones is brittle, aware?

Back to sloth and sleeping binges
Self defeating outburst, cringes
Thoughts get rusty, creaky hinges
Lost that box of clean syringes
Stuck to the ceiling I'm in view
Can't shake the notion I'm becoming you
The look from above same as below
Sign up for high, free dose of low
The Jig is up, I'm the one
Manipulate the ones I love
Light my path, reveal the beacon
Where's my balance
Can't stop thinking
Can't stop thinking
Can't stop thinking
Stop
Searching for substance
Waiting for the impulse
Your thoughts intangible
Around the winding road
Sinus pressure getting older
I like weight upon my shoulders
Here I live inside this CD
Tell your friends he's super creepy
Weirded out a simple human
Confused by words arrange and move them
Into spaces apparent meaning
Eat this song your ears are greedy
I can turn it off again, I can smile on a whim
I can make believe in him, the function in the algorithm
I can turn it off again, I can smile on a whim
I can make believe in him, the function in the algorithm

Who drains the blood from my head? 
I do, I do
Who comes through with the meds? 
I do, I do
Blackened seeds you're gonna needs these, freeze
The common ancestor
The pressure of industry
Who sleeps in the grease crease
Wax and trails of mutual deceit
I heard that growth was gettin weak
Who taps the line, records my mind
Twisted agenda, align my spine
Whose got the steeples, the people and scepters, the rocks on the beaches, the angles the vectors
Who drains the blood from my head? 
I do, I do
And who accepts me as I am? 
I do, I do
The crack on the staircase, I smoked out of boredom
My kitchen is filled with meat and chloroform
Squirming colors metastasize
Upon viewing the world the fetus eats its own eyes
Acting the fiction and signing the right away
Transistor electrocute, wiping the order away
Awkward offensive hold, perfectly natural
They can't speak 'bout my brand because I'm dead and white

This is my brand, and I charge you the fee
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
I jumped inside the blender, now drink me
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
Rage against the reflection
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
Buy this shit stained product infection
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
Wax and wane, and wax and wane, I wanna soak up the glory
Wax and wane, and wax and wane, I wanna soak up the glory
Yeah turn on my right hand
Yeah turn on my right hand
You know the price ain't right
And if I spin this hype, then I'm award winning actor man
Yeah turn on my right hand
Push with your clout, pull the mud out your mouth man
I'm only christening what's mine
You come back once and then the second time for blood
That's my trope, and my sleight of hand
I'm about to predict the future
Any credit given will be swept under the rug
Or reduced to the fine print
I'm only silent when you're asking questions
The simple answer is "no I wasn't present"
All I see is an ocean of replicas
All I see in their eyes is my reflection

What I had in mind was
What you held against me
Never satisfied
Or just never coming back
No, prep him for the ghost
Let him see the ghost
Let it in and come to terms with what would have, could have been
Prep him for the weight
Let him see the fate
Fracturing relationships
And isolation
What I had in mind was
What you held against me
Before you decide that this is dated
Take me out of the equation
What was it that you most hated?
All the time that you spent waiting
When the stomach becomes the mouth and its spewing all its garbage out
To think before speaking would prevent you from the point you're making
When the stomach becomes the mouth and its spewing all its garbage out
To think before speaking would prevent you from the point you're making
The slew of trails towards destiny, the perfect day to quit
The slew of trails in reverie, bite my crooked shape
Got a box of lies
Gonna get you high with the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book
And I'm not a crook
But ill take your guilt in the form of dollars
Got a box of lies
Gonna get you high with the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book
And I'm not a crook
But ill take your guilt in the form of dollars
Its all that
Its all that
Never fold under pressure
Never mind how I got there

Be your rock, I'll be your guide
Without you it's suicide
Until then I'll watch you sleep
I'm just tying the knot
I'm just tying the knot
I've got the sickest picture of you in my mind
I get the strangest urges all of the time inside
Take part in this demonstration, rope mixed with wine
I hope to follow through with you cause the timings right
Stuck inside the living room
Tangled faces, glow in tune
I can't monitor what I consume
Slap your wrist, accept the sentence

Put it in my fist and squish n twist with the wrist
Hotter than my
That's my body, it's a device
Turn on the anti rape mechanism
Porcelain shooters, walk past the moon
Macroscopic view
Piece together, shards into cables
Swollen shoulder rotator cuff
Clandestine, makeshift vestibule
Pardon the unstable broken stuff
I did college, majored in smart, concocted ways to be useless and poor
Successful could barely describe the shape of my infinite wisdom, I can spit from mouth
The esoteric, righteous believer, repeat the process, becoming a monk
The morality was it derived from or intrinsically inherent
Cold blocks pop, concocts an instant freeze
I'm consistently drawn to the smell of please
Flooded brain tips I'm seeing shapes like trees
Turn it on its side and rape the vertices
Ripple lifter christening his new bought bricks
Grip my magic, force the page to slip
Rope burn mistress in the cage with a limp
Turn it on its side and smack the weak out the wimp
For slump
Get it away from me
Get it away from me
Empty it out
Empty it out

His self-repairing skeleton
Cyborg man's computer blood
Programming immunity
Alpha being
His knowledge expands exponentially
As he rapidly evolves at infinitum
Deleting disease, cut and sever
Cells and metal blend together
Replicating, assimilating, science and biology
The death of the robot, the birth of him
All at once we'll become him
The death of the robot, the birth of him
One by one we'll become him
In future utopias, alpha hybrids evolve
Into progressive societies, worship efficiency
Technology makes me pray to logic
And science makes us strong
We rape the ignorance of man
Prepare the arrival
Right on time
He arrives
Alleviate the symptoms from
A toxic society
We praise the future

I'm sick of twisting the knobs, your little baby's a slob
I wanna love you but this house ain't built for two
I think I panic a lot, not really sure what I've got
I wanna love you but this house ain't built for two
I'm sick of twisting the knobs
I think I've hidden from myself, but there's too many layers
I turn my head and cough
Like I'm calling the cops
Is there something more to you than just bible study?
To my sunstroke ghost dance gold corona
Did I crack that lens, put my weight upon ya
Does the manifest dictate to love and honor
Can the creed uphold, can we repeat our mantra

Trust my luck and show my feelings
Cross my fingers, cards are dealing
Busting out my skull shaped ceiling
Hold my fucking body back
I'm still raging from the sanction you placed upon the impoverished nations
Delusions of grandeur, have some patience
Hold my fucking body back

Shimmy my way down underground, polluting airways in my wake
Swaying architecture, grappling a birthday cake
It's analogy backfire, in the cliché storm of backwards prose
Shoot the agony beam
Wearing sacrificial clothes
Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to hear what you're seeing
Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to know what you're feeling
If it's making sense on time, then why do I hear their whines?
If it's moves and breathes it's fine, don't let it mess with your mind
Paging Dr. Mess your patient's throwing food and ate his robe
Quantum something can do anything
An accidental public confession was made
I was in a viper fight, but I'm alright
Confused cause I'm too dumb to find the light
Carcinogenic isotope, we need the A-team montage
Disregard the message from the ending of the album

Stomp that feeling; your puke is a mutant
Can’t think of who did this, well I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it’s admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger
Separate is the way though, no second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your god
See you in battle; your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business; your plaque on my wall
You’ll forget I’m wrong
Do it again, do it again, do it again, now grow
I run quickly out of air, by the way I hate your celebration
I run quickly out of air, by the way I hate our aging faces

It’s so relieving to show my ray
Beam of belief in identity
It’s not deceiving to be this way
I came to show you my sack
The things that you do with your attitude
I’m awkward, I’m chipper, I’m random dude
The picture, I like it, so don’t be rude
We all came here just to fap
Only I share with the lesson, I’m mocking it
Letting the pear flip its shape
Top of the tumor its rumored I’m neutered
A fabulous rape in the taint
Expecting the people to live in your head
If you knew what to do, then you’d do what you said
Proxy the awesome and seek the deletion of reaper repeating submission face
Opt for the option to stop this exhaustion and breathe through the tube of civility
The end is, the end is, the end is, the end of days
I have something important too

Stuff that big, bottomless cup in my hand
Fill up this riddled with curses, old man
Acting like enemies out of my way
Still won't break up with the things I have made
Nah, I don't do that anymore
No people, just places I adore
Too bad I lost the feeling
Leave it alone I'm asleep so I'm healing
All great things have battle scars
You wanna swap this belief with a greater art
My flesh road has only grown into a mattress fit for mounting
I've faced this allergy. It won't go away
Upgraded salary, employment virus aid
I've faced this allergy. It's everything I thought that I could fake
I see me riding off, off through the clouds
I see me riding off, off to the bitter end
I see me riding off, off through the clouds
I see me writing off, off all my bitter ends

Pop that, shock and awe, get that grab it, go go claws
I go broke when I assume I suck
Flex my settlement, I’m selling stuff
Get that, go in raw, have a baby, adopt a dog
Well I blasted enacted and off to space
Well I practiced adapted, and it felt great
Legs don’t matter, they’re just softening, I’m limping
Bugs don’t matter, no death is suffering, just squish it
Legs don’t matter, they’re just softening, I’m limping
Bugs don’t matter, no death is suffering, just squish it

Why can't I seem to find my mind?
The time is almost up
It's wide, I'm fried, and died inside
It's deep and broken up
Host of the feelings left, isn't there
Ran outside to waste his cares if had done faster, then I'm spared to sleep instead of suck
Maybe it's time to quit the game. It wasn't me. The world is drunk
I'm a piston on a mission, pumping out my guts
She said I was something like a filler in her molar
A hibernating Siamese twin on her shoulder
I lose my shit enough, I bite a bit off more than I can chew
You collected fashion tips and now I wear a cage
Stuck in a batters grip, faking a limp
Happy to cry, waiting for gifts, biding my time
I injected apathy attempt to disengage
Avoiding those parroting...They won't decide a, they won't decide a, they won't decide a, they won't decide a thing
I'm so sick in the brain, I don't even practice keeping in touch
Throw my thoughts in the drain
The clutch of abraxas stone, torn deep through the rug
Watch my drippin bone erupt, as I bellow the message, complete with the flood, when the hot fog rolls on a match and sparks it up
Ribbon lip quiver, God callin' when I've had enough
I'm lost
If had done faster, then I'm spared to sleep instead of suck
Maybe it's time to quit the game
It wasn't me
The world is drunk

The belief is a burden and a crop
Now the dream is only a memory
Cry, mine is mine, I clamp my head in the crease
Of a familiar smell
I think the tree is a thief
I'm fryin' everything that incubate and ever was
Simmer fifteen rips before I croak and die
I flipped that maggot out
I sniffed that dragon's brew
I say I'm feelin' when everyone is on my side
We think we're relevant
Hey, we think we're being admired
It's slipping into this
All of you, all the heads inside the hole of cause
We're getting intimate
It's a flu, in a vein
How do we disconnect from the arm?

Talk about your feelings
I'm goin pitch black
Talk about my feelings
I don't wanna, fuck that
It don't believe me I mustn't whip that
Soft as the pillow is, ship this shit back
Stand up and notify the registry
I'm buying a house in a shit storm economy
Make love, I plagiarized the books I read
My infinite wisdom, belligerent at lightning speed
I'll go get the decider
I'll be the center divider
I could be more than just "Hey bro, listen."
I'll be claiming you flaggin
I'll be braggin I'm admin
I could fulfill the people's crave for pigskin
Who am I kidding?
Who am I kidding?
Small world syndrome, I can hear your criticism, buh- buh- bouncing off the base of my buttons
You bluffin
I could go get the biggest brick so you could break in
I could constrict the citizen to make a payment

To condone this great offense, I address the audience
Our grip is strong or impotent
We're wise to hype this up
Call on the creed and prophesize you'd witness this event
The infant's egg is monetized, a privilege heaven sent
Under the spell of it, we're wise to hype this up
A new former shell of it, I'm wise to hype this up

It’s that one type of night with the bright white ice pick
Slipped up signature, wrestle till I scribble shit
Who in my space smell khaki leather pants?
If my brain go missin, I’ll be damned
The one ripped by the wind
Instant implant
How we see what we thought was nothing before
Now the lost and the waste can slide beside them
Perform the custom of hissing lisp adorn
I know them and I know what
I think I’m a start this up
Like the fastest object overgrowth, like a basket lobbin egg and yolk, I got the bombest little habit
Watch my head explode like the plant lion synthesized this shit

Please make way for the special invented armor
Mental protection if reality is raging harder
Hello, Mister Mime; hello, Medicine
I believe denial makes me hella intelligent
I know we trust each other; don’t fail the litmus
We all need partners for the pain of existence
My bedroom chemistry set ended up on your Pinterest
Pledging allegiance to a few common interests
Claw my way to the top of the centipede
The sum of its parts is prescribing me symmetry
Every bone picked and decision was orchestrated
Cut the head off and the legs’ll call the action complacent

Death murders everything in sight
Beneath the rip in the wind, the pillar push you aside
If I make way, I can taste your sigh
Just like the cannibal amp, it knows sound is size
“Push me to the brink,” I said
Well that bitch is a creep, it tried to know what I think
To breathe out passion, or suck in fate
You think the world was made to wield your weight and bleed out?
Mirin myself all by myself
Feel the caress so sweet, done by my hand
Polishing this frame of mind, jacked it up an ax to grind
Duck ‘n dodge, stay unaligned
My recognition face
Some get withered, some get fried
I know we talked about the shit we did each time
Polishing this frame of mind, jacked it up an ax to grind
Duck ‘n dodge, stay unaligned
My recognition face

I am lost
Need a God
I am blind
Give me eyes
I conceive a better way to lie
The witnesses evaded
Everywhere I look I feel the weight
So wait it out now
I know a guy
Somewhere
Whose got a guy
From town
Who knows a guy
From around
Whose gotta die
I called my sister’s cousin, uncle, friend, made sure to trust them time and time again
The group is never ending
The group grew from decay
The group is darkness, father
Heaven selected the truth as pain

Gimme that canvas let me paint some shit
I'm just embarrassed and comfortably numb
Cheers to the fact that we're not dead
Swimming with the sharks, but we're still not dead yet
Psycho I go
Right to buy those
Optimistic, magic fix it pills
I'm so right though
That's my life bro
Underwater
Coughing with my gills
I'll go in cryo and return to life ho
And make a Bisque, some tomato basil shit
Riding a rhino pico de gallo
Roosters beak, I'll sleep when I leap that jeep
Hades arc
Golden tarp
Black hole
Slack is for
Slack is for cutting me more
Mountain
Fountain
Shrieking
Preaching
Slack is for
Slack is for cutting me
Slack is for cutting me more
For every little bit of sunshine I call freedom
White 21 is the maximum fun
For every little bit of sunshine I call freedom
White 21 is the maximum fun

Don't worry, no
You don't have to bear your soul about it, no
Go away, you can't stay
You got no more reasons left to come my way
Go away, you can't stay
You got no more reasons left to come my way
Brain, robot wang
Gonna slang through the tang
I-8764, the sex assistant
I-8764, it's no commitment
I wish I didn't miss this
They call me hedonistic
I make them kiss they sistas
He flips his black ass robot hair

It never was compatible but something made it flammable
Don't bother having a conscience
Now stuff our life into bags
Sit around and waiting, thinking how you're treated
Feeling like you're fading
Complaining and wasting away
I slip the sloppy g'day, the drink is always amazed
At how much I would like to let it control me
I make a pact with my friends we'll never lose a game again
Unless the shots I take are served from the bar
I'm about to dunk
But I'm stuck inside a funk
I'm scared of getting punked
So I'll become a drunk

Cocaine cringe fest

Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest
The current year
I know just the thing, the thing to say
I got just the just the song to play
Free your mind from the cage
I can talk a mile a minute
Cracked out, snap out of it
I don't care I'm in it
Cracked out, snap out of it
Mo blow...WOW!

Half wrapped in a leopard print sex swing
The beat is shit and I'm bout to make a new slang
If your momma was a bed of kites then we could fly away
And fuck this night right
I feel the brick wall hit
I feel the will I trick
Pay your debt, don't suffocate
If you're baking it, don't eat the cake!
If you're faking it, then show 'em the bait!
Don't be so disgusting
Like wind on the wick
I see the symptoms inside of your binges
I checked that you were dead
I check then I got sucked in

I don't really wanna be the bitch that gives a shit & bottles it
Deliberately swallows it, one less contestant life
They'll provide the documents to make believe you're gonna fit
Spend your time as militant self help perfection hype
Aliens have spoke to me and shown me how to see
The parable is terrible but but I don't give a sheet
A penis wide that towers high is cumming at your feet
The stories old, the butthole full of cancer spreading meat
I don't really wanna be the bitch that gets it shit & bottles it
Deliberately swallows it, one less contestant life
They'll provide the documents to make believe you're gonna fit
Spend your time as militant self help perfection hype
I can hear a smacking from the corner of the world
A flap then another flap that their bird has shat a pearl
Oil commerce tipped the scale and soaked up all the dung
And flung it back for us to catch and eat out of their bums
So impressionable
Attend the festival
So impressionable
Attend the festival
The fact of the matter
You thought that it mattered?
You thought they were flattered?
I'm convinced you're an actor
You can take off the wrapper
Yeah I'll whip up the batter
But there's nothing you can bake
If your face ain't light
Them crackers act fake tonight

Dry crossing up the holy five hate
Your cousin is my hobby free throw
I'd toss my calling card but I'd hate to make a baby feel slow
Nope, bro, there's lots of answers to shit
Like the numbing that you feel is real, then pain grows
You'll get for what you asked
Patience is the lane I mate with case closed
All cranky in a blanket with a lazy eye
Same pigeon that was shitting on the other guy
Why yo fitness need a witness?
I too can cook a bunch of little meals
Friend, make my life
I picked 'em up and clipped their hype
It was the tamest type the little bitch couldn't listen
I flipped it up and twisted night
Into a padded white room
Bitch named "Kristen"
I felt my body craving the oxygen from ancient wasteland aching
I wanna be the man with the bacon
Make a light reveal the only stake in
Fakeness, fucked

That's my public figure
Taking perfect pictures
It's time to shock the blaow!
Do a bitta good analysis
Let's balance this
Not backing out
Put a little bitta time in this
A finalist and not in doubt
I shake my scepter fresh and you smell like sphincter
I'll pass my credit check and run through your sprinklers
I grow tired of this game
Make me feel like I'm to blame
Fake cry, don't be that guy
The one who tries to victimize himself to hide a web of lies
I just watched you do that all to you
Find another person you can use
You're not that clever, easy to see through
Tear the best of us apart
Don't take offers then
Act like you think you're gonna lose
Make things awkward to see you faking gratitude
Instructed to go auto-pilot, don't know the password
You're sitting on a dildo pile
That's why your ass hurts
You're so high, I'm so high
You're so high, we're so high

My mental image impaired
Undid the braids in my hair
I rain destruction in the fight of my inner feels
Remove the tricks of the trade
You're just alone on the stage
There's no witness fly your soul through the windshield
Take a sip from the drain
The flavor tastes like nothing
Or nothing tastes the same cause nothing is never there

I know what I'm talkin bout
I believe the words in my mouth
Cause I can say that it was all just a metaphor
You know that I won't stop
I'm coming back on top
Don't call that it's a flop
I got the refs on lock

I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body
Black cat, brown rat
Face off vs. fruit bat
The greatest fight we've seen yet
Immaculate tact
Green clam, yellow lamb
Fight purple face ram
Bets are in it's not a scam
Find out who wins
It's just an animal, ass whoop
Show
Puppy dog had an accident
Damn it, mammal
Kangaroo cracks its dick in half
The crowd sprayed crimson
Shark dad ate a baby calf
You still like burgers
Clip clop, clip clip clop
Horse comes out and beats your parents up
Blue dog, red frog
Face off vs. big hog
Balancing on wet logs
Swamp bog, thick fog
Gray duck, white beaver
Fight golden retriever
One has meat cleaver nick-named "Life Eater"
Ride in the hammock with a bleeding fist
My white sides splitting like the ironic
Cucked little critter from the boards
I sniff around on triggering the weeb racists
Both sides are shit, both sides are flipped
Ripped off the jaw of the idealist
Pick from one of any, fantasy pipe dreams

I could see it gleaming from the back of my dinner ware
Your eye cream sprayed all over little bear
You could reconsider definition of childcare
14 shapes and you pick the giant square
I could see it gleaming from the back of my dinner ware
Your eye cream sprayed all over little bear
You could reconsider definition of childcare
14 shapes and you pick the giant squareSince 2005 I've been living a lie
I'm not even a man I'm just a cat in disguise
I was born by surprise in the Egyptian times
Bring me a treat and I'll imprint your face forever
I fuck them bright clothes the white guy guy code
Burnt all the bridges it's just a pile of wood
I couldn't wait though admit I ate those
Book flavored pavement endorphing tongues
Shy fiction cloud absorbing pictures
Appearence shining
Eclipse a culprit ear intake
A pillapliption mixed in soap and whipped in dear face cloak
To steep me peefers with needle bop
I think of things that I haven't done
Packer Wilita, Tilly, Billy, block blood


Fade, writhe, crash, peel
I'm feeling it, the feel of it, the wheel can turn
The wick is lit
I feel like something before I feel like nothing
Facilitate the power trip
I like to watch you deal with it
Savor every little bit of knowledge you obtain
Pride, feed me pride I'm feending
You can never ever diss on this dick
You can barely even write this shit!
More, give it more conejo!
Feed it pieces, make it sleepy!
I think you're perfect, I'm worth it, yeah
I deserve to be a servant!
I think you're perfect, I'm worth it, yeah
I deserve to be a servant!
Say I'm worth it
I'm your person
So well-versed in
I'll immerse in you
Dive through the heart of a demon
Shine a light on my kingdom portrait
Fly straight over the pieces of you
Suck sludge straight through the straw I need you
Fade, fade, fade, fade, fade into the grave…

Endorphin orphan morphin
Lemon cheese equally
You know my origin story, born in the cemetery
I'm into stupid apps, like cry-yo-own self back to sleep
My rock is solidbucks, these people ameniti-ties
Get another round of weirdo in em
Turn around slow and rear yo head
No one allowed to solve the riddle, ha
Kiss my kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss my kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye
I test this cable, I plugged into a tree
I play the tokin tone from straight off the leaf
I got the smoothest roots that spew out the feet
There's a clue in a plant and it can bite off the teeth of disease

How, how could we forget about you
The summoner, the centerfold,successor to the brood
Of all the iterations yeah you're the sickest dude
Fighting cow, how could we forget about you

Show up at the ball wit yo doo doo faced babe
The robot with human hair is dead but gets laid
That’s why he’s got all these kids on the way
His son’s a girl named baby swirl that loves to swang his blade

Brontosaurs fear of art is torn apart by making
Good mistakes and branching out he switch it up like baking
The more I tried to sleep it off the more I started thinking
I wanna live in mushroom park, do unrestricted shrinking
Made up magic turtle guy is feeling like he’s crap
He needs to spend some time alone to understand his path
There's different types of waves and things your mind is tuning to
It takes in information and it sorts it out for you
I'm kissing a baby that licking a boot
I live in a deli put meat on your tooth
My business is pregnant and flaunting off nude
I'm smoking a chicken I took out the coupe
Show off addictions and make it sound fiction
You aren't doing art if you're dead in the park
If you feel like you died show 'em you have
Give up your life for the virtual clap
Shear off the weird and then watch 'em appear
Now you’re a spiritless fearless lil lyricist
Shear off the weird and then watch 'em appear
Now you're a spirtless, fearless lil lyricist
Hoax

There is no operation
Doctor Mess goes flagrant
Till' he makes you leggo yo eggo

Robbin' them cribs
Don't let those veterinarians
Close to your kids
Did dis dude just did dis?
Now I done gone through these body bags
Let's make this dinner a classic
Cook up some breakfast and bounce

I remember you back in the day
Prodigy show 2003
We were camping out in Jnco jeans
The ecstasy was super clean
I never wanted to be caught up in not looking back
I never wanted to be treated like a psycho
I couldn't face another second of your vacant threats
I couldn't shuffle through the pieces of my costume

There ain’t nothing you can do to change it
Empathy is overrated
Look the other way
Always been my game
Come up in my closet I'ma get you fat
That's a chill initial feeling when I come right back
I can see the orchids blooming out your beautiful crack
Since my head is now my belly I need big brain snacks
Welcome to my odd ass city with the lopsided loaves
The limp wristed winded sex on abdomen
What's my style I'm blind to dude tooth clang
Chomp real loud I tuned out all intervals
Looking through the glass watching eyes cry glitter
Slid in on a sack laced in body suit slipper
I'ma peel in two and then shed my image
Turn into some panoramic spinning gold bridges
Cah Shwink

I got a sudden itch
They're gonna raise my rent
I'm gonna run around, let people know I don't need this

I want to, I'd like to, I'm gonna file, yeah
March around, through the town
It's all goin' down, wow
Been a little while since we played as kids
I found it impressive the way you worked those wooden limbs
But she's amazing for every occasion
I want a lot more of your mom around
I'm sad she's gone and couldn't have more time
To notice all the ways her bright ass shines
But he's impatient. Creeps on Brayden
No one really likes your dad around
Now that's winter's over and you got an apartment
I think about the times when we shaved our armpits
And she was gracious
Knew we were wasted
I wish we had more of your mom around
The big city life is getting busy and hectic
We should reconnect and have sex in my Lexus
And he was racist
Except for Asians
And no one really likes your dad around

Eye yai yai yai yai
I'm stuffed
Eye yai yai yai yai
Nice pup
Eye yai, Eye yai
Eye yai, Eye yai
Eye yai yai yai
I'll never replay yuh

Wore out my wheels while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeals hear the seal bout to break
Wore out my wheels while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeals, hear the seal bout to break

Retired is a word that I hate
I go quiet 'cause I know how to think
Skunk pliers are the tools of the dank
Young friar is my new chicken drank
Why you try and go and touch people
Eight hundred sixty seven bald eagles
Why you try and go and touch people
Eight hundred sixty seven red beetles
Asses, asses, asses in battle
Die die die die die ya bad apples
Asses, asses, asses in battle
Use your face like a dumbass rattle
My accent my glibness. A bee dipped in brass
I'm stuck on the isthmus connecting my past
A passionate servant when I'm paid in cash
Don't ask if it's worth it. Don't think bout the math

There's no complaining in the mansion
You can't just do what I do
I chuck my brain through the black
Climb up the tree
Shoot out the cannon
Fuck her cause she reads
Punctuation violation perpetrator is verified
Hi hi hi hi
Flunked out and flung from the front of your face wait
I smell Sharon's pimple, it's the size of grapes
I'm so splintered that my mind waved back
I had cash but sold it for some soul I'm da wraith

The brightest of wizards I bit her and love came on gushing out
Guzzled some lizards my skin turned to scale. Felt it wrap around
Payments get vicious. Account gettin' roasted and flayed
I started a party, and partied, and partied, and flew away

What a feeling when I'm feeling the feel for real
I'm over woke and flippin' a table
I shed a tear and then appear in the mirror
Still here, but blasted out through pineal cable
Same vein but different textures
I'm finna whip my hip out my frame
Twist bone that hooks through the braid
Loops lonely needs a twin action
Fast enough to flip back the attraction
I can see it and it's audibly wobbly
Tastes just like a can of broccoli
Fishin' hook like slimy apostrophe
One letter missing 'tween two monstrosities
Cut after cut of liquid energy
Beams are buffed and I'm like "yay"
Back in the beast, hate this impulse slave
Close it up and then ride the wave
I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
Snake round the wheel, now I know what I've known
I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
All wrapped up and ravin' and rolled through the snow, go
Go
Go
Go
Go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
Don't act like you know me
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
It's under control
I see the glass half poured
And then I pee inside the pitcher
I wanna wet the bed
'Cause it reminds me I'm a swimmer
And when I feel like Greg
Then I remind me that I'm Jon
I like to make a mess
And then shit on every song
We're at the end of the mission, no need for decisions
I jump off a cliff, I like this
We're at the end of the mission, no need for decisions
I fall in a ditch, I like this

You don't need a baby
You need to go crazy
You need to meet god

Put it in a painting
A picture of it raining, a symbol of us

Double double dare
You pissed off your parents
Now your car

Gonna take care
It's yours, not our hair
And so we have fun
Hack, slash, braid and cut
Twist, curl and tease the tuft
Blow it out and spray the stuff
Slick it back and fluff it up
Hair song
It's a great one to get ready to
Have your friend do your make up fool
Catch up with a dear loved one
You can make it hard or you can make it fun
You don't need a baby
You need to go crazy
You need to meet god

Put it in a painting
A picture of it raining, a symbol of us

Double double dare
You pissed off your parents
Now your car

Gonna take care
It's yours, not our hair
So we have fun

If you need some company
You should meet these obligations
What's responsibility
It ain't permanent vacations
Yeah you think you give a great hug
No, Yeah you think you give a great hug
No, yeah you squish your little face smug
Oh, Oh, Oh 
Oh, Yeah you got your validation huh?
Yeah, be your own patient
Oh, Yeah you got your validation huh?
Yeah you squish your little face smug
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Check your ballot and vote this dick, right?
You gotta eat, right?
You gotta eat, right?
I'm not looking down and then looking away
I'mma cook a brat like I cook a filet
Nobody out here has been talking to Dave
Will ain't even liking what you had to say

Do you even love her?
Do you even love her?
Thats your own mother!
Bloodsucker
I figure that was another ass hard ass part
My coke's inside this bloodied rag
I'm in a stats class smoking backpack pie chart
With a grove of muddy greaser bees
You gotta be on alcohol
To hang out in a shopping mall
There's nothing left to buy that isn't cheaper online
The only reason I'm alive is
Waiting for the A.I. to do some tight shit
And lemme suck its fucking dick
She like it puffy, comfy and lumpy
Make your ass a frumpy dumpy bro
Squawk, seven-five
Zero zero mane
World in a barrel dripping some blood

Three dead riders
Grippin' the reigns of saturn
In da last plastic cup
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
I feel like I'm gonna stay
I feel like I'm gonna change
I feel like I'm gonna stay
Step back, let go, step back, let go
I believe there's meaning, no I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning, no I believe there's nothing
Step back, let go, step back, let go
Who drains the blood from my head? I do, I do
Who accepts me as I am? I do, I do
Repeat repeat, repeat repeat
Repeat repeat, our history
