Gimme that canvas 
let me paint some shit 
I’m just embarrassed and comfortably numb 
Cheers to the fact that we're not dead 
Swimming with the sharks, but we're still not dead yet
 
Psycho I go 
Right to buy those 
Optimistic, magic fix it pills 
I’m so right though 
That's my life bro 
Underwater 
Coughing with my gills

I’ll go in cryo and return to life ho 
And make a bisque, some tomato basil shit 
Riding a rhino pico de gallo 
Roosters beak, I’ll sleep when I leap that jeep

Hades arc 
Golden tarp 
Black hole 
Slack is for 
Slack is for cutting me more 
Mountain 
Fountain 
Shrieking 
Preaching 
Slack is for 
Slack is for cutting me 
Slack is for cutting me more

Brain, robot wang 
Gonna slang through the tang 
I-8764, the sex assistant 
I-8764, it's no commitment

I wish I didn't miss this 
They call me hedonistic 
I make them kiss they sistas 
He flips his black ass robot hair

It never was compatible but something made it flammable 
Don't bother having a conscience
Now stuff our life into bags
Dunk in shame and sink into my shell 
And play it over and over again until the favors end 
Sit around and waiting, thinking how you're treated 
Feeling like you're fading 
Complaining and wasting away 
I slip the sloppy g'day, the drink is always amazed 
At how much I would like to let it control me 

I make a pact with my friends we'll never lose a game again
Unless the shots I take are served from the bar 
I’m about to dunk 
But I’m stuck inside a funk 
I’m scared of getting punked 
So I’ll become a drunk

I know just the thing, the thing to say 
I got just the just the song to play 
Free your mind from the cage 
I can talk a mile a minute cracked out, snap out of it 
I don't care I’m in it 
Cracked out, snap out of it 
Mo blow 

Half wrapped in a leopard print sex swing 
The beat is shit and I’m bout to make a new slang 
If your momma was a bed of kites then we could fly away 
And fuck this night right 

I feel the brick wall hit
I feel the will I trick 
Pay your debt, don't suffocate 
If you're baking it, don't eat the cake! 
If you're faking it, then show 'em the bait! 
Don't be so disgusting 
Like wind on the wick 
I see the symptoms inside of your binges 
I checked that you were dead 
I check then I got sucked in 

I don't really wanna be the bitch that gives a shit & bottles it 
Deliberately swallows it, one less contestant life 
They'll provide the documents to make believe you're gonna fit
Spend your time as militant self help perfection hype 

Aliens have spoke to me and shown me how to see 
The parable is terrible but but I don't give a sheet 
A penis wide that towers high is cumming at your feet 
The stories old, the butthole full of cancer spreading meat
