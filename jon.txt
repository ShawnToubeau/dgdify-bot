gimme that canvas let me paint some shit
I’m just embarrassed and comfortably numb
cheers to the fact that we're not dead
swimming with the sharks, but we're still not dead yet
psycho I go
right to buy those
optimistic, magic fix it pills
I’m so right though
that's my life bro
underwater
coughing with my gills
I’ll go in cryo and return to life ho
and make a bisque, some tomato basil shit
riding a rhino pico de gallo
roosters beak, I’ll sleep when I leap that jeep
hades arc
golden tarp
black hole
slack is for
slack is for cutting me more
mountain
fountain
shrieking
preaching
slack is for
slack is for cutting me
slack is for cutting me more

brain, robot wang
gonna slang through the tang
I-8764, the sex assistant
I-8764, it's no commitment
I wish I didn't miss this
they call me hedonistic
I make them kiss they sistas
he flips his black ass robot hair
it never was compatible but something made it flammable
don't bother having a conscience
now stuff our life into bags

dunk in shame and sink into my shell
and play it over and over again until the favors end
sit around and waiting, thinking how you're treated
feeling like you're fading
complaining and wasting away
I slip the sloppy g'day, the drink is always amazed
at how much I would like to let it control me
I make a pact with my friends we'll never lose a game again
unless the shots I take are served from the bar
I’m about to dunk
but I’m stuck inside a funk
I’m scared of getting punked
so I’ll become a drunk

cocaine cringe fest
I know just the thing, the thing to say
I got just the just the song to play
free your mind from the cage
I can talk a mile a minute
cracked out, snap out of it
I don't care I’m in it
cracked out, snap out of it
mo blow (wow)

half wrapped in a leopard print sex swing
the beat is shit and I’m bout to make a new slang
if your momma was a bed of kites then we could fly away
and fuck this night right
I feel the brick wall hit
I feel the will I trick
pay your debt, don't suffocate
if you're baking it, don't eat the cake!
if you're faking it, then show 'em the bait!
don't be so disgusting
like wind on the wick
I see the symptoms inside of your binges
I checked that you were dead
I check then I got sucked in

I don't really wanna be the bitch that gives a shit & bottles it
deliberately swallows it, one less contestant life
they'll provide the documents to make believe you're gonna fit
spend your time as militant self help perfection hype
aliens have spoke to me and shown me how to see
the parable is terrible but but I don't give a sheet
a penis wide that towers high is cumming at your feet
the stories old, the butthole full of cancer spreading meat
I can hear a smacking from the corner of the world
a flap then another flap that their bird has shat a pearl
oil commerce tipped the scale and soaked up all the dung
and flung it back for us to catch and eat out of their bums
you thought that it mattered?
you thought they were flattered?
I’m convinced you're an actor
you can take off the wrapper
yeah I’ll whip up the batter
but there's nothing you can bake
if your face ain't light
them crackers act fake tonight
dry crossing up the holy five hate
your cousin is my hobby free throw
I’d toss my calling card but I’d hate to make a baby feel slow
nope, bro, there's lots of answers to shit
like the numbing that you feel is real, then pain grows
you'll get for what you asked
patience is the lane I mate with case closed
all cranky in a blanket with a lazy eye
same pigeon that was shitting on the other guy
why yo fitness need a witness?
I too can cook a bunch of little meals
friend, make my life
I picked 'em up and clipped their hype
it was the tamest type the little bitch couldn't listen
I flipped it up and twisted night
into a padded white room
bitch named "kristen"
I felt my body craving the oxygen from ancient wasteland aching
I wanna be the man with the bacon
make a light reveal the only stake in
fakeness, fucked
that's my public figure
taking perfect pictures
it's time to shock the blaow!
it's here, it's right there, for you to take it all
do a bitta good analysis
let's balance this
not backing out
put a little bitta time in this
a finalist and not in doubt
I shake my scepter fresh and you smell like sphincter
I’ll pass my credit check and run through your sprinklers
I grow tired of this game
make me feel like I’m to blame
fake cry, don't be that guy
the one who tries to victimize himself to hide a web of lies
don't take offers then
act like you think you're gonna lose
make things awkward to see you faking gratitude
instructed to go auto-pilot, don't know the password
you're sitting on a dildo pile
that's why your ass hurts
I just watched you do that all to you
find another person you can use
you're not that clever, easy to see through
tear the best of us apart

you're so high, I’m so high
you're so high, we're so high
my mental image impaired
undid the braids in my hair
I rain destruction in the fight of my inner feels
remove the tricks of the trade
you're just alone on the stage
there's no witness fly your soul through the windshield
take a sip from the drain
the flavor tastes like nothing
or nothing tastes the same cause nothing is never there

I know what I’m talkin bout
I believe the words in my mouth
cause I can say that it was all just a metaphor
you know that I won't stop
I’m coming back on top
don't call that it's a flop
I got the refs on lock
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
and I’m just waiting in a body
black cat, brown rat
face off vs. fruit bat
the greatest fight we've seen yet
immaculate tact
green clam, yellow lamb
fight purple face ram
bets are in it's not a scam
find out who wins
it's just an animal, ass whoop
show
puppy dog had an accident
damn it, mammal
kangaroo cracks its dick in half
the crowd sprayed crimson
shark dad ate a baby calf
you still like burgers
clip clop, clip clip clop
horse comes out and beats your parents up
blue dog, red frog
face off vs. big hog
balancing on wet logs
swamp bog, thick fog
gray duck, white beaver
fight golden retriever
one has meat cleaver nick-named "life eater"
ride in the hammock with a bleeding fist
my white sides splitting like the ironic
cucked little critter from the boards
I sniff around on triggering the weeb racists
both sides are shit, both sides are flipped
ripped off the jaw of the idealist
pick from one of any, fantasy pipe dreams
I could see it gleaming from the back of my dinner ware
your eye cream sprayed all over little bear
you could reconsider definition of childcare
14 shapes and you pick the giant square
I couldn't face the fact that my ass ain't a plaque
there's a wall and my behind is not there
I couldn't wait to tap into the brain of my cat
and let him know he's my widdle baby meow meow boo
since 2005 I’ve been living a lie
I’m not even a man I’m just a cat in disguise
I was born by surprise in the egyptian times
bring me a treat and I’ll imprint your face forever
I fuck them bright clothes the white guy guy code
burnt all the bridges it's just a pile of wood
I couldn't wait though admit I ate those
book flavored pavement endorphing tongues
shy fiction cloud absorbing pictures
appearence shining
eclipse a culprit ear intake
a pillapliption mixed in soap and whipped in dear face cloak
to steep me peefers with needle bop
I think of things that I haven't done
packer wilita, tilly, billy, block blood
fade, writhe, crash, peel
I’m feeling it, the feel of it, the wheel can turn
the wick is lit
I feel like something before I feel like nothing
facilitate the power trip
I like to watch you deal with it
savor every little bit of knowledge you obtain
pride, feed me pride I’m feending
you can never ever diss on this dick
you can barely even write this shit!
more, give it more conejo!
feed it pieces, make it sleepy!
I think you're perfect, I’m worth it, yeah
I deserve to be a servant!
dive through the heart of a demon
shine a light on my kingdom portrait
fly straight over the pieces of you
suck sludge straight through the straw I need you
fade, fade, fade, fade, fade into the grave
How, how could we forget about you
The summoner, the centerfold, successor to the brood
Of all the iterations yeah you're the sickest dude
Fighting cow, how could we forget about you
Show up at the ball wit yo doo doo faced babe
The robot with human hair is dead but gets laid
That’s why he’s got all these kids on the way
His son’s a girl named baby swirl that loves to swang his blade
Brontosaurs fear of art is torn apart by making
Good mistakes and branching out he switch it up like baking
The more I tried to sleep it off the more I started thinking
I wanna live in mushroom park, do unrestricted shrinking
Made up magic turtle guy is feeling like he’s crap
He needs to spend some time alone to understand his path
There's different types of waves and things your mind is tuning to
It takes in information and it sorts it out for you

I'm kissing a baby that licking a boot
I live in a deli put meat on your tooth
My business is pregnant and flaunting off nude
I'm smoking a chicken I took out the coupe
Show off addictions and make it sound fiction
You aren't doing art if you're dead in the park
If you feel like you died show 'em you have
Give up your life for the virtual clap
Shear off the weird and then watch 'em appear
Now you’re a spiritless fearless lil lyricist
Shear off the weird and then watch 'em appear
Now you're a spiritless, fearless lil lyricist
Hoax
There is no operation
Doctor Mess goes flagrant
Till' he makes you leggo yo eggo
They schemin', bottom-feeding
Robbin' them cribs
Don't let those veterinarians
Close to your kids
Don't fight, it's too magnetic
Did dis dude just did dis?
Space blood done made you an addict
Now I done gone through these body bags
Let's make this dinner a classic
Cook up some breakfast and bounce
I remember you back in the day
Prodigy show 2003
We were camping out in Jnco jeans
The ecstasy was super clean
I never wanted to be caught up in not looking back
I never wanted to be treated like a psycho
I couldn't face another second of your vacant threats
I couldn't shuffle through the pieces of my costume
Look the other way
Always been my game
Come up in my closet I'ma get you fat
That's a chill initial feeling when I come right back
I can see the orchids blooming out your beautiful crack
Since my head is now my belly I need big brain snacks
Welcome to my odd ass city with the lopsided loaves
The limp wristed winded sex on abdomen
What's my style I'm blind to dude tooth clang
Chomp real loud I tuned out all intervals
Looking through the glass watching eyes cry glitter
Slid in on a sack laced in body suit slipper
I'ma peel in two and then shed my image
Turn into some panoramic spinning gold bridges
Cah Shwink
I got a sudden itch
They're gonna raise my rent
I'm gonna run around, let people know I don't need this
 want to, I'd like to, I'm gonna file, yeah
March around, through the town, It's all goin' down, wow
Been a little while since we played as kids
I found it impressive the way you worked those wooden limbs
But she's amazing for every occasion
I want a lot more of your mom around
I'm sad she's gone and couldn't have more time
To notice all the ways her bright ass shines
But he's impatient. Creeps on Brayden
No one really likes your dad around
Now that's winter's over and you got an apartment
I think about the times when we shaved our armpits
And she was gracious
Knew we were wasted
I wish we had more of your mom around
The big city life is getting busy and hectic
We should reconnect and have sex in my Lexus
And he was racist
Except for Asians
And no one really likes your dad around
Eye yai yai yai yai
I'm stuffed
Eye yai yai yai yai
Nice pup
Eye yai, Eye yai
Eye yai, Eye yai
Eye yai yai yai
I'll never replay yuh

Wore out my wheels while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeals hear the seal bout to break
Wore out my wheels while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeals, hear the seal bout to break

Retired is a word that I hate
I go quiet 'cause I know how to think
Skunk pliers are the tools of the dank
Young friar is my new chicken drank
Why you try and go and touch people
Eight hundred sixty seven bald eagles
Why you try and go and touch people
Eight hundred sixty seven red beetles
Asses, asses, asses in battle
Die die die die die ya bad apples
Asses, asses, asses in battle
Use your face like a dumbass rattle

My accent my glibness. A bee dipped in brass
I'm stuck on the isthmus connecting my past
A passionate servant when I'm paid in cash
Don't ask if it's worth it. Don't think bout the math

There's no complaining in the mansion
You can't just do what I do
I chuck my brain through the black
Climb up the tree
Shoot out the cannon
Fuck her cause she reads
Punctuation violation perpetrator is verified
Hi hi hi hi
Flunked out and flung from the front of your face wait
I smell Sharon's pimple, it's the size of grapes
I'm so splintered that my mind waved back
I had cash but sold it for some soul I'm da wraith
The brightest of wizards I bit her and love came on gushing out
Guzzled some lizards my skin turned to scale. Felt it wrap around
Payments get vicious. Account gettin' roasted and flayed
I started a party, and partied, and partied, and flew away
What a feeling when I'm feeling the feel for real
I'm over woke and flippin' a table
I shed a tear and then appear in the mirror
Still here, but blasted out through pineal cable
Same vein but different textures
I'm finna whip my hip out my frame
Twist bone that hooks through the braid
Loops lonely needs a twin action
Fast enough to flip back the attraction
I can see it and it's audibly wobbly
Tastes just like a can of broccoli
Fishin' hook like slimy apostrophe
One letter missing 'tween two monstrosities
Oh...Blast!
Cut after cut of liquid energy
Beams are buffed and I'm like 'yay'
Back in the beast, hate this impulse slave
Close it up and then ride the wave
I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
Snake round the wheel, now I know what I've known
I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
All wrapped up and ravin' and rolled through the snow, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
Don't act like you know me
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
It's under control
I see the glass half poured
And then I pee inside the pitcher
I wanna wet the bed
'Cause it reminds me I'm a swimmer
And when I feel like Greg
Then I remind me that I'm Jon (Hi Jon!)
I like to make a mess
And then shit on every song
We're at the end of the mission, no need for decisions
I jump off a cliff, I like this
We're at the end of the mission, no need for decisions
I fall in a ditch, I like this
You don't need a baby
You need to go crazy
You need to meet god

Put it in a painting
A picture of it raining, a symbol of us

Double double dare
You pissed off your parents
Now your car

Gonna take care
It's yours, not our hair
And so we have fun
Hack, slash, braid and cut
Twist, curl and tease the tuft
Blow it out and spray the stuff
Slick it back and fluff it up
Hair song
It's a great one to get ready to
Have your friend do your make up fool
Catch up with a dear loved one
You can make it hard or you can make it fun
If you need some company
You should meet these obligations
What's responsibility
It ain't permanent vacations
Yeah you think you give a great hug
No, Yeah you think you give a great hug
No, yeah you squish your little face smug
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Yeah you got your validation huh? 
Yeah, be your own patient
Oh, Yeah you got your validation huh?  
Yeah you squish your little face smug
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Check your ballot and vote this dick, right?
You gotta eat, right?
You gotta eat, right?
I'm not looking down and then looking away
I'mma cook a brat like I cook a filet
Nobody out here has been talking to Dave
Will ain't even liking what you had to say

Do you even love her?
Do you even love her?
Thats your own mother!
Bloodsucker
I figure that was another ass hard ass part
My coke's inside this bloodied rag
I'm in a stats class smoking backpack pie chart
With a grove of muddy greaser bees
You gotta be on alcohol
To hang out in a shopping mall
There's nothing left to buy that isn't cheaper online
The only reason I'm alive is
Waiting for the A.I. to do some tight shit
And lemme suck its fucking dick
She like it puffy, comfy and lumpy
Make your ass a frumpy dumpy bro
Squawk, seven-five
Zero zero mane
World in a barrel dripping some blood
Three dead riders
Grippin' the reigns of saturn
In da last plastic cup
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
I feel like I'm gonna stay
I feel like I'm gonna change
I feel like I'm gonna stay
