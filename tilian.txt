Say you don't hate me for nothing
Hate me for falling out of reach
Hate me for something
Never knew that you could be so lonely, lonely
Running out of feelings so pretend you can be lonely, lonely
Stuck in your mind
Can't let it go
What hurts you the most
Is I wasn't there to beg you
'Baby don't go'
Put on a show
Light it up
Light it up
No, it's not a phase
It's the way that she combs my hair
Never wake
Never wake from this coma
Light it up for us
Show me the way you're growing
Your catharsis is beautiful
I wish I could be you
Brighter
How I wish I could touch you
Feel you, breathe you, be just like you
Used to be so judgemental
Now I respect the ones
Who dare to be sinful
I was searching for my pride
Now I know it's all fleeting
Just glad to be alive
You're salty, can't fault you
I'm numb to the rhythm that guides you
Take all your confetti away
I know, I know what's killing me
Don't need your love or sympathy
I know, I know just what you'll say
Don't you try to rescue me
Won't fight you, not like you
But I’m numb to the rhythm that guides you
I’ll take your confetti away
Don't you try to rescue me
Don't you try to rescue me
Now you're on a midnight crusade
Flexing your stats
But you can't touch me, touch me, touch me
Tell me how to think my own way
You can give it your best
But you won't touch me, touch me, touch me
You got me begging for an answer
Indecision's cancer
Waiting at your beck and call
I don't know how long I can take it
Trying to read your body language
Only got you moving back and forth
How long, how long, do I got, do I gotta wait?
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster
Canceled my pride for an ounce, for an ounce of faith
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster
Over and over
Over and over you're complicated
Over and over I'm fascinated
Frustrated
For now we'll lay by the ocean
For now no one is around
For now we'll act like we're still young
For now we'll never come down
I know you're not empty
I know you're still there
I know you're not empty
I know
You still care
Higher than all of their voices
Higher than fading away
Got lost, lost in the moment
Got lost in tempting our fate
And you can rub it in my face
Sabotage all my connections
The parasites won't go away (the parasites won't go away)
They live inside you
Got nothing clean for you to taint (got nothing clean for you to taint)
Already gave you a confession
Propagating every consequence (propagating every consequence)
'Till hate consumes you
I never wanted to be caught up in not looking back
I never wanted to be treated like a psycho
I never wanted to be singing about you again
But you keep locked in your possession half of my soul
God damn, you caught me looking back
God damn, with no discretion
God damn, you got me going mad
God damn, it's an obsession
So you don’t believe in magic
I’m never falling from these habits
No
Who’s ever really static
Just take my honor you can have it
Don’t get all sentimental about it, oh no
The sun comes up, the rain comes down
There ain’t nothing you can do to change it
Don’t get all sentimental about it, oh no
Life’s not fair
Empathy is overrated
Look the other way
Always been my game
Got a way of cleaning
All the shame tryna stain to my name
Look the other way
Darkness in the shade
Got away with feeling
Like I’m faking every single breath I take
Got away pretending like I’m faking every single word I say
Stay, wait
Doesn't matter what they say, fake
Doesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix
We can taste what it's like to love
I don't know you very well
But they don't have to know that
We don't have to show that
I'm at the top of my little world
But I never felt so alone
The more it seems like I've grown the more
I've been shrinking in
I drown myself in material
Waiting for some kind of punishment
But consequence don't make no sense
When there's nobody there who gives a damn
Stay, wait
Does it matter if I pay? Fake
Doesn't matter if you make me believe you can feel anything
I can vaguely relate to love
Where do you wanna be?
Have you settled for the comfort of security?

Half-baked
What a waste
Out of shape but not overweight
If you show restraint you can separate
Wanted you to know
I came close to being another echo
Don't have a soul
But I'm on a roll

Comfort in the words of a swindler
Everybody needs approval
One love in the holes of a savior

Act like you're above them
All the lives you're running
Will you ever feel it again?
Like you're part of something

Worth fighting for
Worth dying for
Leave me
Looked like I was someone I could barely recognize
Hope it's not too late to scatter this disguise
Sand trap, the only path is still under construction
An infinite selection
I hide away
Pacing back and forth
Some vanity is what I need
But I'm stuck slouching
I lie awake
When all my dreams fall short
Of everything that I could be
If I stopped slouching
Come back to my range
If you can't hang you know I won't change
She'd be a model if you gave her some time
She'll spin the bottle if you give her a sign
My friends and I have parted ways
You know I love to make mistakes
I'm a disaster no one's laughing
Goodbye
The memories will fade away
Tomorrow will be yesterday
The worst is yet to come
At least I'll get there all alone
No one around to judge
Judge what I've become
I got nobody left to blame
No hopeful trust for me to break
Been dying faster, no one's laughing
Be my bruiser, trust me I'm a loser
You're a classy lady, how'd you get so bad?
I'm unruly, tie me up and school me
You've got privilege baby, how'd you get so sad?
And you can love me, hate me
Just don't try to save me
Call my name and drag it through the mud
Love me, hate me
Go on try to break me
Go on try to break me
These voices attacking my head
Distracting me from what I knew I should have said
But I got a shred of dedication
Maybe some desperation
We're all having fun
Blow it up, blow it up now
Grow it up, grow it up
Forget what they say about me
I'm in here where they can't touch me

Right now ain't no one above me
All my faithful children love me

Will I leave my woes behind?
Where I go to burn my time
It's the brightest I can shine
In this world I breathe divine
They say, 'Don't ever meet your heroes'
Reverence is temporary until the truth comes out
Do yourself a favor die young, ignorance is celebrated
Don't let dark sides come out
Keep your eyes closed
If you're ever gonna stand for something
Keep your head down, closed
If you want to keep your mouth don't run it
Shut that shit down
Fear it
Lately, I've been feeling like all my friends I used to love
Have turned out to be sociopaths
Do they even know what it's like in the real world?
Too busy getting high
Now their vacancies are a reminder of
All the ways I used to sell myself
Lack of compassion down for the cause
Feeding the fever whatever the cost
Wanna deify opinion
Evidence is secondary
East-west equals North-south
Do yourself a favor die young
Ignorance is advocated
Don't let gospel burn out
Somehow you can breathe somehow
What a waste of paradise
Sucking life
You've become predictable
Way you play is typical
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain
Face facts, you'd love to be attacked
The retroactive pieces fit to match all your embellishments
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain
I will watch you suffer like a good consumer should
Popcorn in my belly tells me you're misunderstood
Wait, I feel nothing
Am I becoming desensitized to virtue touting?
Judgments they're scowling, pigeons they're howling
Nobody stops to listen
Can't take it back
Accusations, fact
Denial becomes evidence to crucify the innocent
Settled in the victim's role
He'll languish in the pain
Couldn't make me into a hero
Couldn't turn me into a coward
Whatever history that you wrote
Blew away in the wind on your way down from your ivory tower
Your words lost their power
You can aim down fire
We'll be down here living how we want
You always see right through my
My masquerade
I know there's nowhere to hide
I'm cellophane
All of the handsome fiction
Will melt away
And when the flame burns brighter
Evaporate
All of the fabrications
Will melt away
And when the flame burns hotter
Evaporate
