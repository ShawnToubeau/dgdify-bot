Before you ask what you think you want to know
Take a look at my face and how far you think I'll go
Because I've had it up to here for the 37th time this year
And I've kept it bottled down
But not this time, not here
'Cause I'm fucking on one
I feel the marrow in my bones
Heart is beating, heavy breathing
Can't stop me when I'm in my zone
Blood is colder, taking over
I feel the marrow in my bones
Heart is beating, heavy breathing
Can't stop me when I'm in my zone
Blood is colder, taking over
You've seen me arrive
Shed my disguise I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to
Keep it alive
Fight to survive I thought you wanted to I thought you wanted to

I wear my soul on my sleeve at night
I lose control of my autonomic mind
And I saw the rage burning in your eyes
Follow me down, we'll get paralyzed
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Feed into the miracle
Don't be fucking cynical
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Girl don't be so difficult
Come here let's get physical
Cut out this conversation, desperation
Now, losing admiration, holding onto accidents
What have I done, what have I done?
That calls for your attention?
What have I done, what have I done?
That keeps you hanging on?

Relationships are a tool that can fuel the facade over my disguise
Fulfill my ego I do what I do with unrelenting compromise
When it's all on the table you know I'll be able to duck, dodge and run and hide
Got a good education in disinformation, adept at constructing lies
And I will get it all on my own
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
So what
I'll die
Alone
So what
I'll die
Alone
So what
I'll die
Alone
So what
I'll die
Alone
So what
I'll die
Alone
I'm terribly wasted
You're coming to pieces
Let’s get fucking naked
And fall off the deep end
The world's a stage and I'ma wax and wane
Like moon till they're lit like the sun
The world's a bitch and I manipulate it
You'll believe every word I say

I'll have to leave just as soon as the colors begin to fade
I'll run away before lying to you becomes natural
Give me the keys and I'll drive you insane
Take apart your brain if you ever loved me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Do you wanna get mad about.. All your feelings won't change the world
Do you wanna get mad about.. Saying nothing, being nothing, be with someone else
I'll have to leave just as soon as the colors begin to fade
I'll run away before lying to you becomes natural

I was raised to believe
All, all that I read
Fall in line with me
It's all, all that I see
Fall in line with me
It's all that I see
What I believe 
Fall in line with me
It's all that I see
What I believe
It's all that I see
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never mind how I got there

I will never let you leave my sight
I've been staying up lately, all night
Making sure you get to bed safely
Dreaming of when it will be you and me
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
You go there and I'll go too
I'll be the one that follows you
Watch you sleep and watch you wake
Notice all the moves you make
Can't wait til the day we meet
Until then I'll watch you sleep
Oh
Can't wait to catch you all alone
Oh
Girl, then I swear I'll take you home
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not
Commenting is hardly rude
Body count competition
Childhood memory demolition
Ain't my fault if I'm irrelevant
I'm always watching you

Cancel my vacation, I'm on a terabyte
Seeking persuasion from desperate minds
Numbers and figures replacing reality
Conquering patrons with dexterous lines
All these imposters are making me addicted
Conformist reason is all I can trust
No matter how hard I lie they believe it all
No matter how hard I lie they believe it all

Hush now don't you cry
Everything will be just fine
You won't realize it's over
Til you slip into unconsciousness
And the moment takes over
Swallow your pride my soldiers
And embrace your abilities
Let your new mind take over
I take a bow
Listen to the crowd
My survival is all I think about now
It's for the best
We'll cure the helpless
Our survival is all we'll think about now
Hush now don't you cry
Everything will be just fine

So where's my sweet love
Turn your camera on
You don't wanna miss this
The way lighting shifts
As it reflects off the water
Below this sinking ship
I feel your fingertips.. slipping away
Can't shake the feeling now
How far we've fallen down
Like our best days are behind us
You're the revisionist
And I'm the narcissist.. drifting away
I can't predict the future
And I can't forget the past
Can't focus any longer
Desperate to make this last
Keep us from going under
Won't waste all that we have
You called it in November
And it burned up in a flash

Burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash
Feel the hangover in my mind
But this one's a different kind
Losing touch with the concept of time
My senses are frozen
Losing touch with my concept of time
My senses are frozen

You always keep me coming back for more
So many faces in the world but I want yours
The way you make me feel inside my bones
I can't remember how it feels to be alone
And when you call my phone late at night
Anticipation always burns me up inside
I haven't slept for weeks
Just a couple more and I'll be yours
I'll be coming home again
And we'll tear apart those sheets
And forget the world, a little while
Get to know your form again
Do you feel alone when I'm not home?
Touch as you please, you should feel free
Easier said than done
Can't be the only one
That jacket looks good on most people
Finally exiled
Overcome by circumstance
I put my life in the devil's hands
Fell lower than before, lower than ever before
I know it's hard to forgive me now, but I swear I've taught myself how
To barricade the door
I won't go there anymore
Overcome by circumstance, separated by consequence
I fell lower than before, lower than I have before
If I could just get through to you, we could put in the final screws
To the barricade the door
And start back where we were

Forget my jealously
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said
"We own the night"
Let your hair down have one more round
Drink til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes
Baby, this is living
Roller-coaster
Up and down in random motion
Oh come in closer
Ditch your problems, better days are coming

Get up off the wall come on get down get down
Give into moment and live now live now
Get up off the wall come on get down get down
Give into the moment, feel it now

I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you
We own the night
Call your phone and open up my fate cuz I know you're so connected
I need poison mitigate my pain
Feel my toes go golden up in flames
Give me false hope in my veins
Tranquilize and modify my brain
Where did I go wrong?
There's nothing I can do the thrill is gone
So I play these nervous songs
Pretend that I’m not barely hanging on
And medicate
Medicate
Medicate me all night long
Medicate
Medicate
Medicate me all night long

I'm in love with the feeling that I’m loved
Not alone, so alone
Take my money take all that I've got
All that I've got
And I'm daydreaming of a taste I can't hold back
Stroke my ego turn me into God
I am god
And we can get it in the open
Tell me all your secrets
Show me how to make you mine
Cuz you got me feeling nervous
Know I don't deserve it
But you’re giving me the signs
I bet you never saw me coming
But I’ve had my eye on you for miles
Just had to get it in the open
Take off all your clothes and
Baby let me blow your mind
Baby let me blow your mind
Cuz I need it the most, so baby let blow your mind
I'll keep hiding in this cul de sac
Day dreaming of a taste I can’t hold back
Is there a God?

Please don't talk about me with all your friends
I'll never leave you, so easy to say
I never loved you, stay the hell out of my way
Sick of being on my game
And understated
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Taken all that I can take
I'm gonna make it
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Brand new
That's it, it's over, I'm done
Give me the keys to the car
Put the pedal to the metal as we're falling apart
And I don't wanna see the phony look on your face
I should have never fallen for it in the first place
Touch me, fool me, tame me, make me all about it
When I bleed, you scream, shame me, I'll leave, over-dramatic
I'll live in the moment, you gave me a reason
Then I fell asleep in the bathroom
Mixing magic potions, looking for a meaning
Get myself out of this costume
Sick and tired of counting bubbles in the ceiling
Feel like a prisoner in my head
I was only trying to forget the feeling
I get when I think of you
Beautiful and tragic
Beautiful and tragic

Right now I need somebody
A little taste of honey
I'm giving in this time
Temptation running wild
Shutting down my mind
You got me on the run
You know me more than anybody
You caught me with the gun in my hand
But I don't care about anybody but you
I'm on a roll
I can't contain myself
I need a taste
Don't tell me that we're done
I know you more than anybody
I'll make it up to you I swear
Cause I don't care about anybody but you
I got a feeling that you're dropping the bomb tonight
And leaving me on my own
Took all your pictures off the wall and you were cold as ice
When we talked on the phone
If you want it come home maybe we could work it out
You know I would take it back if I could
Or we could leave it in the past and try make it out
Hit the radio and set the mood
I did you wrong now let me atone
Cause I don't think we'll make it all alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone
I got a feeling that we're here to stay
Stick with me and I can take you there
I'm not about to throw it all away
Holding on to what we got, so rare

It's like it never even happened
I never got to know this side of you
Frozen all connections
Now I can't find the person that was you
Oh no. I can't remember
The leaves were bound to change
I loved you in the summer
The leaves were bound to change
When I saw you there, looking like a shadow of what you were, I could see my sorrow
Shining in the moment when you turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around my world
Shining in the moment, hit me with the cold. I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm without you, girl
Snow falling, downpour
Snow falling, downpour

I've got style
I work harder than anyone, and I can do it while I'm having fun
Yeah I'm a get, I'm a get, I'm a get, get better
I want to be, I want to be somebody
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be somebody
Now, now, slow your roll
Keep your head low
Your life is a joke
Don't make this awkward
Lay back in the fold
Can't make it alone
You're too fucking old
Don't make this awkward
Now and then
I get a little bit full of myself and start dreaming
I can't help it
But you're a friend
You keep my feet on the ground and my head out of the clouds
Show me how to doubt myself
And who knows where
I'd be without you
Now and then
I get a little bit full of myself and start dreaming
I can't help it
Am I a fool not to run?
Your nicotine in my lungs
How can I trust anyone but you?

And I'm assuming that you're worth it
You would never break my heart
The way you're killing me is perfect
Bleed me out and leave no scar
I got a feeling I deserve it
Wanna hurt me? Baby, get in line
The way you're killing me is perfect
Stare until it makes me blind
Prey on my spirit til you come alive
Hydrate my fire 'til it smolders out
Can't fight the feeling this is meaningless
Who am I kidding I can't breathe without...
Oh, it's calling me
I can't turn away
Treat me like a slave
I'll come willingly
Oh, you're the reason I get out of bed
Still can't fight the feeling this is meaningless
Meaningless

Turn up the radio
Give 'em what they want
Play their favorite song
Make it sensational
Sing it from the heart
Illuminate the dark
You've been holding back for so long
Time to grow up
Come into your own
Aim for the moon, no looking back
Sing it
I'm strong, I am the decider
I am all the reasons, an animal
I am every season
I am legend, all because of you
Do it for both of us
But march to your own drum, because I am old and done
Swear I can feel the rush
Watching you become everything I'm not
You've been holding back for so long
Time to grow up
Come into your own
Aim for the moon, no looking back
Sing it now
I made you this way
You have me to thank

I’ve had a little bit too much
Don’t wait for me
I’ll wake up on my own tomorrow
I took a little medicine love to lubricate my flow
Don’t wait up for me cuz I’ll be coming home tomorrow
Eagle vs Crows

Sick of being in my head and thinkin' about my fate
And worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing
And blow through all my wealth
I made some mistakes, not so good with planning
But I got some skills in easy living
Cut my ties with desperation and learned to live with a little sensation
Hey!
Just for the day, we’ll pretend I’m made of money
I’ll be your sugar daddy
Hey!
Let’s make a fool of ourselves and crash a party
Act like we own the place
Act like we own the place
Swinging back and forth,
All my faults are peaking past the surface
Is it worth it to fall back down?
We’re way too caught up in the race with time
It’s getting hard to take it in
We’re trying hard to be the first in line
Just wanna be a kid again, a kid again
Sick of being in my head and thinkin' about my fate
And worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing
And blow through all my wealth
I made some mistakes, not so good with planning
But I got some skills in easy living
Cut my ties with desperation and learned to live with a little sensation
Over, over, overwhelmed again
Singin' out, out
Bury it away
Killing all the flies
I’m not done swinging back and forth yet
Forgive me for what I will do

We lie cold
Dam up the river we can go slow
We don’t wanna know
Dull down our senses
Become numb
We take our time ignoring all the signs
Living in fear of our lies
Never bad enough to break it or good enough to feel right
Been in overtime half our lives
Under indecision, we become so dependent on the rush of the moment
Sanitize my head
Am I the reason that you can’t look past your future self?
Got me believing you been stuck and glued in frequent doubt
I know the feeling cuz I can’t keep my mind open now
Make up your mind
We’re running out of time
Doubt is failure by design
I’m burning up
Can only take so much
I know you can feel it, it’s catching up
It’s getting too heavy for both of us
We lie cold
Dam up the river, we can go slow
We don’t wanna know
Dull down our senses
Become numb

I am lost
Need a God
Somewhere to go when it’s all over
I am blind
Give me eyes
Kaleidoscope the world in color
Don’t have time to meditate the meaning of the rain
Synchronize our memories til we all think same way
'Cause I get lost
Need a God
Help me put my world in order
I don’t wanna know the truth
I just need feel secure again
Codify my wasted youth
So I don’t feel this meaningless again
Tickle my animal instincts, survive
Capable, sociable subject, I’m part of the pack
We crave a greater existence, survive
Attainable, modified purpose
I’m part of the pack
Citizen of the world
Oh no, he said a bad word
We should burn him at the stake
Desecrate his name
Spit on him from high horses
Exaggerate the shame
He’s ignorant and vulgar
So evil we can tell
He’ll surely rot in hell
A homophobic sociopath, a menace to us all
He’ll take the fall
The fall

Pass me some poison let me take a hit
Dress code, cocktails, looking so fancy
We feel like we're a little bit classy
Don't let this moment go to waste you don't know when the feeling could happen again
Don't let this moment go to waste you don't know when the feeling could happen again
Touch me, taste me, tell me I'm not fading
Tell me that I look just like a man
Cause lately baby I've been going crazy
Trying not to be an embarrassment
Touch me, taste me, tell me I'm not fading
Tell me that I look just like a man
Cause lately baby I've been going crazy
Trying not to be an embarrassment
Don't close your eyes tonight
Perfect melodies are hard to find
I got a feeling we could touch the sky
Let's live in this delusion that we don't live in perpetual confusion and there's meaning to our lives
For every little bit of sunshine I call freedom
White 21 is the maximum fun
For every little bit of sunshine I call freedom
White 21 is the maximum fun

This time won't blame myself
It's been long time coming, been a long time coming
This time I know you well
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming
Follow me they're gonna follow
Cause I'm on the inside and they're on the outside waiting
This time I know myself
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming
She said "drink that love don't demand it
'Cause baby I can't stand it
When you look so pathetic"
But I can't stop with the rhythm of it
Drink that love, it's like a habit
Feeling like a savage
You know I gotta have it
I, I gotta have it all
Ah-ah, I gotta have it all
Can't stop with the rhythmn, gotta have it all
Ah-ah, I gotta have it all
She said "drink that love don't demand it
'Cause baby I can't stand it
When you look so pathetic"
But I can't stop with the rhythm of it
Drink that love, it's like a habit
Feeling like a savage
You know I gotta have it
I, I gotta have it all
You're on another planet
You're on another planet
Follow me they're gonna follow
Cause I'm on the inside and they're on the outside waiting
This time I know myself
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming

We were young and so jealous and we let it all go to waste
We were young and so jealous and we let it all
Fake the smallest version of myself
Can't shake this moment inside of my head
Dunk in shame and sink into my shell
And play it over and over again until the favors end
You're telling me I'm the chosen one
But lately I've been the frozen one
You're telling me I'm the chosen one
But lately I've been the frozen one
Stop that you ain't no friend of mine
We don't believe your lies
Go on and live your life
Running out the back door
Stop no need to apologize
No way to make it right
Go on and live your life
Running out the back door

Ooh wow you're looking dirty, need a champagne shower now
Lay down let's see if we can get the lipstick to come out


We tried, no luck, it's all right
Trust me honey you look fine
I'll just walk around the city telling chickens that I'm pretty
And I'd love for them to meet my wife
And if we move too slow, let it rot, decay and decompose
If we just let it flow
The fairy dust could tap out 'cause I'm a rolling stone
Never been tied down in one place too long
King of the lonely road
It's all I've ever known
Make your move tonight
Ca-ca-ca-close your eyes don't fight it anymore
And when the sun comes up we won't be wondering what could have been, should have been
Ma-ma-ma-make your move tonight
Make your move tonight

Better wake up before it's all gone
Better wake up before it's all gone
You've never been me before
	
Self-deprecation to settle the score
Here comes the reaper to erase what I've become
I won't be plastic and neutered and numb
I won't be plastic and neutered and numb
I won't be plastic and neutered and numb
I won't be plastic and neutered and numb
I couldn't help it made me wonder
If you're the weight that pulled us under
All of it was make believe, all of it was make believe
And now I'm pulling back the covers
Thought I could trust you like no other
All of it was make believe, all of it was make believe
Deception
Cordial graces, smiling faces, back and forth
Antiquated, overrated, social whores
I don't need you
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you
I don't need you anymore
And there's code for people like you
Always keeping score
And you will never make me like you
Because I'm colder than before
You made me this way
You made me this way

Say you want to know the truth
Well you can ask me a question
I'll tell you something that you may want to hear
But I'll lie, lie
We can make this real
Already tried to go for the gold
Let's go for the stories that remain untold
Say you want to know the truth
Well you can ask me a question
I'll tell you something that you may want to hear
But I'll lie
And I will never let this go
So open wide; because I know you'll always know when you lie, lie
Say you want to know the truth
Well you can ask me a question
I'll tell you something that you may want to hear
But I'll lie
And I will never let this go
So open wide; because I know you'll always know when you lie, lie
I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass
And everybody on my dick like preacher, preacher
I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass
And everybody on my dick like preacher
Preach to me, tell me what you see
Tell me what I need to do and who to be
'Cause I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass
So let's start a religion
They'll believe in what we say
Let's start a religion
We can blind their eyes with faith
A new religion
We'll tell them where our spirits go
Start a religion
I need my ego to explode
	
A new religion 
We can make some widows cry
Start a religion
Can even plan our own demise
So let's start a religion
We can save some souls tonight
Start a religion
Without me their souls will die

If I fall, will you be there to catch me now?
Catch me now or
If I fall, will you be there to show me how
Show me how I've fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen
I will run laps around you, around you
Go on, try, tug me back to you, but I'll fly
Guess they were right
No way to drag your body and make up the time
So I'll focus on mine, not gonna hold me down I'm leaving you behind
Won't say that you're better
Won't sell you a better lie
Won't tell you etcetera
Won't say that you're doing fine
If your life never turns around
If you should die tomorrow or the week after next
I know that I will be safe and sound
I won't be there cleaning up all the mess

Line them up on a stage
See which ones are clever and which ones declined with age
Watch them fail by design
Or win the hearts of America with manufactured shine
Here comes the winner
Here comes the winner
Here comes the winner 
Here comes the winner
You can find me up on my high horse cutting the bold ones down
They look so hungry, but I'm well-fed, well-dressed dead in the head
It's here, it's right there, for you to take it all
It's here, it's right there, for you to take it all
We don't tolerate whining
You name the time and the place and I'm there
Give me some time and I'll perfect my hair
Roll the cameras honey, love's in the air
We look so poised and not too self aware
I'll pretend I'm better than these clowns and their plastic faces
On another level, pound for pound and their self-abasement
Moments together, sell them well
Oh moments together
Moments together, sell them well
So tell me that I am the love of your life
I'll be in character batting my eyes
We'll show them all the supreme prototype
As ratings and followers peak right on time
I'll pretend I'm better than these clowns and their plastic faces
On another level, pound for pound and their self-abasement

As all my secrets start to show
Spouting reasons not to go my mouth goes cold
You've seen my lies and shame exposed
But I know you know that what we got's no joke
Through all the mud and shit and parasitic cysts
Through all the finger tips scratch scratching at my wrists
Through all the Devils in disguise
I think I can see a little truth in your eyes
As my secrets start to show
My crippled mouth goes cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
And now you're running away
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, don't wander
Still my mouth, still my mouth goes cold
As all my secrets start to show
Spouting reasons not to go my mouth goes cold
You've seen my lies and shame exposed
But I know you know that what we got's no joke
Through all the fear and doubt, two-faced anxiety
Through all the chemicals bouncing inside my brain
Through all my weakness in disguise
I think I can see a little truth in your eyes
We never saw this coming
But I know we'll keep from drowning
What we got ain't close to nothing
I know we got this, know we got this
When all your doubts surround you
I'll keep us both from drowning
Ain't no two ways about it
I know we got this, know we got this
As all my secrets start to show
Spouting reasons not to go my mouth goes cold
You've seen my lies and shame exposed
But I know you know that what we got's no joke

Damaged pride and vulnerable
All my fears are open now
Never thought this would hit me so hard

Staring at my hollow phone
Not sure if you're coming home
Bed still smells like I'm not all alone again
I know we fucked it up this time
We got so high
Couldn't see the bottom

I just crashed my car
And it got me thinking of you
So I just thought I'd call
To tell you, to tell you I, to tell you I still love you
Damaged pride and vulnerable
All my fears are open now
Never thought I could hurt you so hard
Staring at my hollow phone
Wondering if you've found your home
Feel like I deserve to die alone again
We really fucked it up this time
Got so low
Only for a second

I just crashed my car
And it got me thinking of you
So I just thought I'd call
To tell you, to tell you I, to tell you I still love you
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul I know that they ain't never gonna break me
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul I know that they ain't never gonna break me
Damaged pride and vulnerable
All my fears are open now

Going away, vacation
Going away, vacation
Get me out
All your self-commendations
Don't face me now
I'd rather be blind to my malformations
Don't tell me I act like a child, I grew up in a basement
Practicing a smile, practicing a smile

Young enough to feel it, young enough to feel it
My body's young enough to feel this 
Hey
Young enough to feel it
My body rolls, my body rolls
And I, I just want to be in my zone
I just want to be in control
No time for you
And God doesn't have a plan for me
Gonna be who I'm gonna be
No thanks to you
Don't let go
I know you want a little more
Don't be gross and I'll be good to you
Call my phone
I know you want a little more
Let it flow, I can be good to you
You and I, we can linger under starlit skies
Help me survive

Eyes down don't you gaze on others
Pay no mind to hopeful lovers
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
Don't be alarmed to discover, siren songs can pull you under
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
On the seas of mass temptation, keep your course of moderation
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
And if you prove a lying coward, feel the wrath of higher powers
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go
Crawling through the clouds that morph into mouths
Agree to be swallowed, ignore being hollowed out
Don't you hurt me again!
My mind and my body won't be able to take the pain
I'd rather you were dead
Than lying cheating draining my patience away
Eyes down, don't you gaze on others
Pay no mind to vicious lovers
When you go, go, go, go
Act so blind to rediscover, siren songs can pull you under
When you go, go, go, go
Filled with regret
Alone, in the end
Barely a man
I ran from every decision
Not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown
Not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown
I don't need a friend I'd rather keep it all to myself now
'Cause it's hard enough to follow up the fees of my self-doubt
I had it all in the palm of my hand
Don't have the time to start over again
I had it all in the palm of my hand
Ran out of time now it's over again

I followed
Making flirty faces, rounding out the bases
So you'd borrow
Me for the night
Maybe for life
Must have you misunderstood little girl you're a dangerous lady
Just because it feels so good that don't make
That don't make you my baby
Fed me skittles on a burial ground
Gave me rabies in the back of my car
Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart
Now you're just another scar
Now you're just another scar
Now you're just another scar

Only on occasion do lose my patience
I just swallow
All of my pride, but I can't this time
Ohh
Just a little scar tissue in the back of my heart

Say you don't hate me for nothing
Hate me for falling out of reach
Hate me for something
Never knew that you could be so lonely, lonely
Running out of feelings so pretend you can be lonely, lonely
Stuck in your mind
Can't let it go
What hurts you the most
Is I wasn't there to beg you
"Baby don't go"
Put on a show
Light it up
Light it up
No, it's not a phase
It's the way that she combs my hair
Never wake
Never wake from this coma
Light it up for us
Show me the way you're growing
Your catharsis is beautiful
I wish I could be you
Can't let it go
What hurts you the most
Is I wasn't there to beg you
"Baby don't go"
Put on a show
Light it up
Light it up
No, it's not a phase
It's the way that she combs my hair
Never wake
Never wake from this coma
Light it up for us
Show me the way you're growing
Your catharsis is beautiful
Brighter
How I wish I could touch you
Feel you, breathe you, be just like you

Used to be so judgemental
Now I respect the ones
Who dare to be sinful
I was searching for my pride
Now I know it's all fleeting
Just glad to be alive
You're salty, can't fault you
I'm numb to the rhythm that guides you
Take all your confetti away
I know, I know what's killing me
Don't need your love or sympathy
I know, I know just what you'll say
Don't you try to rescue me
Won't fight you, not like you
But I’m numb to the rhythm that guides you
I’ll take your confetti away
I know, I know what's killing me
Don't need your love or sympathy
I know, I know just what you'll say
Don't you try to rescue me
Now you're on a midnight crusade
Flexing your stats
But you can't touch me, touch me, touch me
Tell me how to think my own way
You can give it your best
But you won't touch me, touch me, touch me

Don't fight, it's too magnetic
Space blood done made you an addict
You got me begging for an answer
Indecision's cancer
Waiting at your beck and call
I don't know how long I can take it
Trying to read your body language
Only got you moving back and forth
How long, how long, do I got, do I gotta wait?
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster

Canceled my pride for an ounce, for an ounce of faith
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster
Over and over
Over and over you're complicated
Over and over I'm fascinated
Frustrated

For now we'll lay by the ocean
For now no one is around
For now we'll act like we're still young
For now we'll never come down
 know you're not empty
I know you're still there
I know you're not empty
I know
You still care
Care
Care
Care
Higher than all of their voices
Higher than fading away
Got lost, lost in the moment
Got lost in tempting our fate
And you can rub it in my face
Sabotage all my connections
The parasites won't go away
They live inside you
Got nothing clean for you to taint
Already gave you a confession
Propagating every consequence propagating every consequence
'Till hate consumes you
I know you're not empty
I know you're still there
I know you're not empty
I know you still care
I never wanted to be caught up in not looking back
I never wanted to be treated like a psycho
I never wanted to be singing about you again
But you keep locked in your possession half of my soul
God damn, you caught me looking back
God damn, with no discretion
God damn, you got me going mad
God damn, it's an obsession
I never wanted to be singing about you again
I never wanted to be singing about you again
God damn, you caught me looking back
God damn, with no discretion
God damn, you got me going mad
God damn, it's an obsession

So you don’t believe in magic
I’m never falling from these habits
No
Who’s ever really static
Just take my honor you can have it
Don’t get all sentimental about it, oh no
The sun comes up, the rain comes down
There ain’t nothing you can do to change it
Don’t get all sentimental about it, oh no
Life’s not fair
Empathy is overrated
Look the other way
Always been my game
Got a way of cleaning
All the shame tryna stain to my name
Look the other way
Darkness in the shade
Got away with feeling
Like I’m faking every single breath I take
Got away pretending like I’m faking every single word I say

Stay, wait
Doesn't matter what they say, fake
Doesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix
We can taste what it's like to love
I don't know you very well
But they don't have to know that
We don't have to show that
I'm at the top of my little world
But I never felt so alone
The more it seems like I've grown the more
I've been shrinking in

I drown myself in material
Waiting for some kind of punishment
But consequence don't make no sense
When there's nobody there who gives a damn

I don't know you very well
But they don't have to know that
We don't have to show that
Stay, wait
Does it matter if I pay? Fake
Doesn't matter if you make me believe you can feel anything
I can vaguely relate to love

Where do you wanna be?
Have you settled for the comfort of security?

Half-baked
What a waste
Out of shape but not overweight
If you show restraint you can separate
Wanted you to know
I came close to being another echo
Don't have a soul
But I'm on a roll

Comfort in the words of a swindler
Everybody needs approval
One love in the holes of a savior

Act like you're above them
All the lives you're running
Will you ever feel it again?
Like you're part of something

Worth fighting for
Worth dying for

Leave me
Looked like I was someone I could barely recognize
Hope it's not too late to scatter this disguise

Sand trap, the only path is still under construction
An infinite selection
I hide away
Pacing back and forth
Some vanity is what I need
But I'm stuck slouching
I lie awake
When all my dreams fall short
Of everything that I could be
If I stopped slouching
Come back to my range
If you can't hang you know I won't change
She'd be a model if you gave her some time
She'll spin the bottle if you give her a sign
I hide away
Pacing back and forth
Some vanity is what I need
But I'm stuck slouching
I lie awake
When all my dreams fall short
Of everything that I could be
If I stopped slouching

My friends and I have parted ways
You know I love to make mistakes
I'm a disaster no one's laughing
Goodbye
The memories will fade away
Tomorrow will be yesterday
The worst is yet to come
At least I'll get there all alone
No one around to judge
Judge what I've become
I got nobody left to blame
No hopeful trust for me to break
Been dying faster, no one's laughing
Goodbye
The memories will fade away
Tomorrow will be yesterday
The worst is yet to come
At least I'll get there all alone
No one around to judge
Judge what I've become
Be my bruiser, trust me I'm a loser
You're a classy lady, how'd you get so bad?
I'm unruly, tie me up and school me
You've got privilege baby, how'd you get so sad?
And you can love me, hate me
Just don't try to save me
Call my name and drag it through the mud
Love me, hate me
Go on try to break me
Go on try to break me

These voices attacking my head
Distracting me from what I knew I should have said
But I got a shred of dedication
Maybe some desperation
We're all having fun
Blow it up, blow it up now
Grow it up, grow it up
Forget what they say about me
I'm in here where they can't touch me

Right now ain't no one above me
All my faithful children love me

Will I leave my woes behind?
Where I go to burn my time
It's the brightest I can shine
In this world I breathe divine

They say, "Don't ever meet your heroes"
Reverence is temporary until the truth comes out
Do yourself a favor die young, ignorance is celebrated
Don't let dark sides come out
Keep your eyes closed
If you're ever gonna stand for something
Keep your head down, closed
If you want to keep your mouth don't run it
Shut that shit down
down, down down
down, down down
Shut that shit down, down, down
Shut that shit down, down, down
Feeling
Lately, I've been feeling like all my friends I used to love
Have turned out to be sociopaths
Do they even know what it's like in the real world?
Too busy getting high
Now their vacancies are a reminder of
All the ways I used to sell myself
Lack of compassion down for the cause
Feeding the fever whatever the cost
Wanna deify opinion
Evidence is secondary
East-west equals North-south
Do yourself a favor die young
Ignorance is advocated
Don't let gospel burn out
Feeling...

 
Somehow you can breathe somehow
What a waste of paradise
Sucking life
You've become predictable
Way you play is typical
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain
Face facts, you'd love to be attacked
The retroactive pieces fit to match all your embellishments
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain
I will watch you suffer like a good consumer should
Popcorn in my belly tells me you're misunderstood
Wait, I feel nothing
Am I becoming desensitized to virtue touting?
Judgments they're scowling, pigeons they're howling
Nobody stops to listen
Can't take it back
Accusations, fact
Denial becomes evidence to crucify the innocent
Settled in the victim's role
He'll languish in the pain

Couldn't make me into a hero
Couldn't turn me into a coward
Whatever history that you wrote
Blew away in the wind on your way down from your ivory tower
Your words lost their power
You can aim down fire
We'll be down here living how we want
You always see right through my, my masquerade
I know there's nowhere to hide
I'm cellophane
You always see right through my, my masquerade
I know there's nowhere to hide
I'm cellophane

All of the handsome fiction
Will melt away
And when the flame burns brighter
Evaporate

You always see right through my, my masquerade
I know there's nowhere to hide
I'm cellophane

All of the fabrications
Will melt away
And when the flame burns hotter
Evaporate
Oh, you should have listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now
Over this by now, I'm found
What excuses do you make?
We own the night
For one good note
Well don't it feel good?
You got what you paid for
Well don't it feel good?
You got what you paid for
