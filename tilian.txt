chemicals bouncing inside my brain through all my weakness in disguise I think I can see a little truth in your eyes we never saw this coming but I know we'll keep from drowning what we got ain't close to nothing I know we got this, know we got this when all your doubts surround you I’ll keep us both from drowning ain't no two ways about it I know we got this, know we got this damaged pride and vulnerable all my fears are open now never thought this would hit me so hardstaring at my hollow phone not sure if you're coming home bed still smells like I’m not all alone againI know we fucked it up this time we got so high couldn't see the bottom I just crashed my car and it got me thinking of you so I just thought I’d call to tell you, to tell you I, to tell you I still love younever thought I could hurt you so hard wondering if you've found your home feel like I deserve to die alone again got so low only for a second in my heart and in my own mind in my soul I know that they ain't never gonna break me damaged pride and vulnerable all my fears are open now going away, vacation get me out all your self-commendations don't face me now I’d rather be blind to my malformations don't tell me I act like a child, I grew up in a basement practicing a smile, practicing a smile young enough to feel it, young enough to feel it my body's young enough to feel this (hey) young enough to feel it my body rolls, my body rolls and I, I just want to be in my zone I just want to be in control no time for you and god doesn't have a plan for me gonna be who I’m gonna be no thanks to you don't let go I know you want a little more don't be gross and I’ll be good to you call my phone I know you want a little more let it flow, I can be good to you you and I, we can linger under starlit skies help me survive eyes down don't you gaze on others pay no mind to hopeful lovers promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go don't be alarmed to discover, siren songs can pull you under promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go on the seas of mass temptation, keep your course of moderation promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go and if you prove a lying coward, feel the wrath of higher powers promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go go, go, go, go, go crawling through the clouds that morph into mouths agree to be swallowed, ignore being hollowed out don't you hurt me again! my mind and my body won't be able to take the pain I’d rather you were dead than lying cheating draining my patience away eyes down, don't you gaze on others pay no mind to vicious lovers act so blind to rediscover, siren songs can pull you under filled with regret alone, in the end barely a man I ran from every decision not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown I don't need a friend I’d rather keep it all to myself now 'cause it's hard enough to follow up the fees of my self-doubt I had it all in the palm of my hand don't have the time to start over again I had it all in the palm of my hand ran out of time now it's over again Say you don't hate me for nothing Hate me for falling out of reach Hate me for something Never knew that you could be so lonely, lonely Running out of feelings so pretend you can be lonely, lonely Stuck in your mind Can't let it go What hurts you the most Is I wasn't there to beg you 'Baby don't go' Put on a show Light it up Light it up No, it's not a phase It's the way that she combs my hair Never wake Never wake from this coma Light it up for us Show me the way you're growing Your catharsis is beautiful I wish I could be you Brighter How I wish I could touch you Feel you, breathe you, be just like you Used to be so judgemental Now I respect the ones Who dare to be sinful I was searching for my pride Now I know it's all fleeting Just glad to be alive You're salty, can't fault you I'm numb to the rhythm that guides you Take all your confetti away I know, I know what's killing me Don't need your love or sympathy I know, I know just what you'll say Don't you try to rescue me Won't fight you, not like you But I’m numb to the rhythm that guides you I’ll take your confetti away Don't you try to rescue me Don't you try to rescue me Now you're on a midnight crusade Flexing your stats But you can't touch me, touch me, touch me Tell me how to think my own way You can give it your best But you won't touch me, touch me, touch me You got me begging for an answer Indecision's cancer Waiting at your beck and call I don't know how long I can take it Trying to read your body language Only got you moving back and forth How long, how long, do I got, do I gotta wait? I'm begging time to move faster Suspended in this disaster Canceled my pride for an ounce, for an ounce of faith I'm begging time to move faster Suspended in this disaster Over and over Over and over you're complicated Over and over I'm fascinated Frustrated For now we'll lay by the ocean For now no one is around For now we'll act like we're still young For now we'll never come down I know you're not empty I know you're still there I know you're not empty I know You still care Higher than all of their voices Higher than fading away Got lost, lost in the moment Got lost in tempting our fate And you can rub it in my face Sabotage all my connections The parasites won't go away (the parasites won't go away) They live inside you Got nothing clean for you to taint (got nothing clean for you to taint) Already gave you a confession Propagating every consequence (propagating every consequence) 'Till hate consumes you I never wanted to be caught up in not looking back I never wanted to be treated like a psycho I never wanted to be singing about you again But you keep locked in your possession half of my soul God damn, you caught me looking back God damn, with no discretion God damn, you got me going mad God damn, it's an obsession So you don’t believe in magic I’m never falling from these habits No Who’s ever really static Just take my honor you can have it Don’t get all sentimental about it, oh no The sun comes up, the rain comes down There ain’t nothing you can do to change it Don’t get all sentimental about it, oh no Life’s not fair Empathy is overrated Look the other way Always been my game Got a way of cleaning All the shame tryna stain to my name Look the other way Darkness in the shade Got away with feeling Like I’m faking every single breath I take Got away pretending like I’m faking every single word I say Stay, wait Doesn't matter what they say, fake Doesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix We can taste what it's like to love I don't know you very well But they don't have to know that We don't have to show that I'm at the top of my little world But I never felt so alone The more it seems like I've grown the more I've been shrinking in I drown myself in material Waiting for some kind of punishment But consequence don't make no sense When there's nobody there who gives a damn Stay, wait Does it matter if I pay? Fake Doesn't matter if you make me believe you can feel anything I can vaguely relate to love Where do you wanna be? Have you settled for the comfort of security?Half-baked What a waste Out of shape but not overweight If you show restraint you can separate Wanted you to know I came close to being another echo Don't have a soul But I'm on a rollComfort in the words of a swindler Everybody needs approval One love in the holes of a saviorAct like you're above them All the lives you're running Will you ever feel it again? Like you're part of somethingWorth fighting for Worth dying for Leave me Looked like I was someone I could barely recognize Hope it's not too late to scatter this disguise Sand trap, the only path is still under construction An infinite selection I hide away Pacing back and forth Some vanity is what I need But I'm stuck slouching I lie awake When all my dreams fall short Of everything that I could be If I stopped slouching Come back to my range If you can't hang you know I won't change She'd be a model if you gave her some time She'll spin the bottle if you give her a sign My friends and I have parted ways You know I love to make mistakes I'm a disaster no one's laughing Goodbye The memories will fade away Tomorrow will be yesterday The worst is yet to come At least I'll get there all alone No one around to judge Judge what I've become I got nobody left to blame No hopeful trust for me to break Been dying faster, no one's laughing Be my bruiser, trust me I'm a loser You're a classy lady, how'd you get so bad? I'm unruly, tie me up and school me You've got privilege baby, how'd you get so sad? And you can love me, hate me Just don't try to save me Call my name and drag it through the mud Love me, hate me Go on try to break me Go on try to break me These voices attacking my head Distracting me from what I knew I should have said But I got a shred of dedication Maybe some desperation We're all having fun Blow it up, blow it up now Grow it up, grow it up Forget what they say about me I'm in here where they can't touch meRight now ain't no one above me All my faithful children love meWill I leave my woes behind? Where I go to burn my time It's the brightest I can shine In this world I breathe divine They say, 'Don't ever meet your heroes' Reverence is temporary until the truth comes out Do yourself a favor die young, ignorance is celebrated Don't let dark sides come out Keep your eyes closed If you're ever gonna stand for something Keep your head down, closed If you want to keep your mouth don't run it Shut that shit down Fear it Lately, I've been feeling like all my friends I used to love Have turned out to be sociopaths Do they even know what it's like in the real world? Too busy getting high Now their vacancies are a reminder of All the ways I used to sell myself Lack of compassion down for the cause Feeding the fever whatever the cost Wanna deify opinion Evidence is secondary East-west equals North-south Do yourself a favor die young Ignorance is advocated Don't let gospel burn out Somehow you can breathe somehow What a waste of paradise Sucking life You've become predictable Way you play is typical Settled in the victim's role You flourish in the pain Face facts, you'd love to be attacked The retroactive pieces fit to match all your embellishments Settled in the victim's role You flourish in the pain I will watch you suffer like a good consumer should Popcorn in my belly tells me you're misunderstood Wait, I feel nothing Am I becoming desensitized to virtue touting? Judgments they're scowling, pigeons they're howling Nobody stops to listen Can't take it back Accusations, fact Denial becomes evidence to crucify the innocent Settled in the victim's role He'll languish in the pain Couldn't make me into a hero Couldn't turn me into a coward Whatever history that you wrote Blew away in the wind on your way down from your ivory tower Your words lost their power You can aim down fire We'll be down here living how we want You always see right through my My masquerade I know there's nowhere to hide I'm cellophane All of the handsome fiction Will melt away And when the flame burns brighter Evaporate All of the fabrications Will melt away And when the flame burns hotter Evaporate
