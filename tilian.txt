Before you ask what you think you want to know
Take a look at my face and how far you think I'll go
Because I've had it up to here for the 37th time this year
And I've kept it bottled down
But not this time, not here
'Cause I'm fucking on one
I feel the marrow in my bones
Heart is beating, heavy breathing
Can't stop me when I'm in my zone
Blood is colder, taking over
I feel the marrow in my bones
Heart is beating, heavy breathing
Can't stop me when I'm in my zone
Blood is colder, taking over
You've seen me arrive
Shed my disguise I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to
Keep it alive
Fight to survive I thought you wanted to I thought you wanted to

I wear my soul on my sleeve at night
I lose control of my autonomic mind
And I saw the rage burning in your eyes
Follow me down, we'll get paralyzed
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Feed into the miracle
Don't be fucking cynical
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Girl don't be so difficult
Come here let's get physical
Cut out this conversation, desperation
Now, losing admiration, holding onto accidents
What have I done, what have I done?
That calls for your attention?
What have I done, what have I done?
That keeps you hanging on?

Relationships are a tool that can fuel the facade over my disguise
Fulfill my ego I do what I do with unrelenting compromise
When it's all on the table you know I'll be able to duck, dodge and run and hide
Got a good education in disinformation, adept at constructing lies
And I will get it all on my own
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
So what
I'll die
Alone
So what
I'll die
Alone
So what
I'll die
Alone
So what
I'll die
Alone
So what
I'll die
Alone
I'm terribly wasted
You're coming to pieces
Let’s get fucking naked
And fall off the deep end
The world's a stage and I'ma wax and wane
Like moon till they're lit like the sun
The world's a bitch and I manipulate it
You'll believe every word I say

I'll have to leave just as soon as the colors begin to fade
I'll run away before lying to you becomes natural
Give me the keys and I'll drive you insane
Take apart your brain if you ever loved me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Do you wanna get mad about.. All your feelings won't change the world
Do you wanna get mad about.. Saying nothing, being nothing, be with someone else
I'll have to leave just as soon as the colors begin to fade
I'll run away before lying to you becomes natural

I was raised to believe
All, all that I read
Fall in line with me
It's all, all that I see
Fall in line with me
It's all that I see
What I believe 
Fall in line with me
It's all that I see
What I believe
It's all that I see
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never mind how I got there

I will never let you leave my sight
I've been staying up lately, all night
Making sure you get to bed safely
Dreaming of when it will be you and me
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
You go there and I'll go too
I'll be the one that follows you
Watch you sleep and watch you wake
Notice all the moves you make
Can't wait til the day we meet
Until then I'll watch you sleep
Oh
Can't wait to catch you all alone
Oh
Girl, then I swear I'll take you home
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not
Commenting is hardly rude
Body count competition
Childhood memory demolition
Ain't my fault if I'm irrelevant
I'm always watching you

Cancel my vacation, I'm on a terabyte
Seeking persuasion from desperate minds
Numbers and figures replacing reality
Conquering patrons with dexterous lines
All these imposters are making me addicted
Conformist reason is all I can trust
No matter how hard I lie they believe it all
No matter how hard I lie they believe it all

Hush now don't you cry
Everything will be just fine
You won't realize it's over
Til you slip into unconsciousness
And the moment takes over
Swallow your pride my soldiers
And embrace your abilities
Let your new mind take over
I take a bow
Listen to the crowd
My survival is all I think about now
It's for the best
We'll cure the helpless
Our survival is all we'll think about now
Hush now don't you cry
Everything will be just fine

So where's my sweet love
Turn your camera on
You don't wanna miss this
The way lighting shifts
As it reflects off the water
Below this sinking ship
I feel your fingertips.. slipping away
Can't shake the feeling now
How far we've fallen down
Like our best days are behind us
You're the revisionist
And I'm the narcissist.. drifting away
I can't predict the future
And I can't forget the past
Can't focus any longer
Desperate to make this last
Keep us from going under
Won't waste all that we have
You called it in November
And it burned up in a flash

Burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash
Feel the hangover in my mind
But this one's a different kind
Losing touch with the concept of time
My senses are frozen
Losing touch with my concept of time
My senses are frozen

You always keep me coming back for more
So many faces in the world but I want yours
The way you make me feel inside my bones
I can't remember how it feels to be alone
And when you call my phone late at night
Anticipation always burns me up inside
I haven't slept for weeks
Just a couple more and I'll be yours
I'll be coming home again
And we'll tear apart those sheets
And forget the world, a little while
Get to know your form again
Do you feel alone when I'm not home?
Touch as you please, you should feel free
Easier said than done
Can't be the only one
That jacket looks good on most people
Finally exiled
Overcome by circumstance
I put my life in the devil's hands
Fell lower than before, lower than ever before
I know it's hard to forgive me now, but I swear I've taught myself how
To barricade the door
I won't go there anymore
Overcome by circumstance, separated by consequence
I fell lower than before, lower than I have before
If I could just get through to you, we could put in the final screws
To the barricade the door
And start back where we were

Forget my jealously
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said
"We own the night"
Let your hair down have one more round
Drink til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes
Baby, this is living
Roller-coaster
Up and down in random motion
Oh come in closer
Ditch your problems, better days are coming

Get up off the wall come on get down get down
Give into moment and live now live now
Get up off the wall come on get down get down
Give into the moment, feel it now

I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you
We own the night
Call your phone and open up my fate cuz I know you're so connected
I need poison mitigate my pain
Feel my toes go golden up in flames
Give me false hope in my veins
Tranquilize and modify my brain
Where did I go wrong?
There's nothing I can do the thrill is gone
So I play these nervous songs
Pretend that I’m not barely hanging on
And medicate
Medicate
Medicate me all night long
Medicate
Medicate
Medicate me all night long

I'm in love with the feeling that I’m loved
Not alone, so alone
Take my money take all that I've got
All that I've got
And I'm daydreaming of a taste I can't hold back
Stroke my ego turn me into God
I am god
And we can get it in the open
Tell me all your secrets
Show me how to make you mine
Cuz you got me feeling nervous
Know I don't deserve it
But you’re giving me the signs
I bet you never saw me coming
But I’ve had my eye on you for miles
Just had to get it in the open
Take off all your clothes and
Baby let me blow your mind
Baby let me blow your mind
Cuz I need it the most, so baby let blow your mind
I'll keep hiding in this cul de sac
Day dreaming of a taste I can’t hold back
Is there a God?

Please don't talk about me with all your friends
I'll never leave you, so easy to say
I never loved you, stay the hell out of my way
Sick of being on my game
And understated
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Taken all that I can take
I'm gonna make it
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Brand new
That's it, it's over, I'm done
Give me the keys to the car
Put the pedal to the metal as we're falling apart
And I don't wanna see the phony look on your face
I should have never fallen for it in the first place
Touch me, fool me, tame me, make me all about it
When I bleed, you scream, shame me, I'll leave, over-dramatic
I'll live in the moment, you gave me a reason
Then I fell asleep in the bathroom
Mixing magic potions, looking for a meaning
Get myself out of this costume
Sick and tired of counting bubbles in the ceiling
Feel like a prisoner in my head
I was only trying to forget the feeling
I get when I think of you
Beautiful and tragic
Beautiful and tragic

Right now I need somebody
A little taste of honey
I'm giving in this time
Temptation running wild
Shutting down my mind
You got me on the run
You know me more than anybody
You caught me with the gun in my hand
But I don't care about anybody but you
I'm on a roll
I can't contain myself
I need a taste
Don't tell me that we're done
I know you more than anybody
I'll make it up to you I swear
Cause I don't care about anybody but you
I got a feeling that you're dropping the bomb tonight
And leaving me on my own
Took all your pictures off the wall and you were cold as ice
When we talked on the phone
If you want it come home maybe we could work it out
You know I would take it back if I could
Or we could leave it in the past and try make it out
Hit the radio and set the mood
I did you wrong now let me atone
Cause I don't think we'll make it all alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone
I got a feeling that we're here to stay
Stick with me and I can take you there
I'm not about to throw it all away
Holding on to what we got, so rare

It's like it never even happened
I never got to know this side of you
Frozen all connections
Now I can't find the person that was you
Oh no. I can't remember
The leaves were bound to change
I loved you in the summer
The leaves were bound to change
When I saw you there, looking like a shadow of what you were, I could see my sorrow
Shining in the moment when you turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around my world
Shining in the moment, hit me with the cold. I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm without you, girl
Snow falling, downpour
Snow falling, downpour

I've got style
I work harder than anyone, and I can do it while I'm having fun
Yeah I'm a get, I'm a get, I'm a get, get better
I want to be, I want to be somebody
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be somebody
Now, now, slow your roll
Keep your head low
Your life is a joke
Don't make this awkward
Lay back in the fold
Can't make it alone
You're too fucking old
Don't make this awkward
Now and then
I get a little bit full of myself and start dreaming
I can't help it
But you're a friend
You keep my feet on the ground and my head out of the clouds
Show me how to doubt myself
And who knows where
I'd be without you
Now and then
I get a little bit full of myself and start dreaming
I can't help it
Am I a fool not to run?
Your nicotine in my lungs
How can I trust anyone but you?

And I'm assuming that you're worth it
You would never break my heart
The way you're killing me is perfect
Bleed me out and leave no scar
I got a feeling I deserve it
Wanna hurt me? Baby, get in line
The way you're killing me is perfect
Stare until it makes me blind
Prey on my spirit til you come alive
Hydrate my fire 'til it smolders out
Can't fight the feeling this is meaningless
Who am I kidding I can't breathe without...
Oh, it's calling me
I can't turn away
Treat me like a slave
I'll come willingly
Oh, you're the reason I get out of bed
Still can't fight the feeling this is meaningless
Meaningless

Turn up the radio
Give 'em what they want
Play their favorite song
Make it sensational
Sing it from the heart
Illuminate the dark
You've been holding back for so long
Time to grow up
Come into your own
Aim for the moon, no looking back
Sing it
I'm strong, I am the decider
I am all the reasons, an animal
I am every season
I am legend, all because of you
Do it for both of us
But march to your own drum, because I am old and done
Swear I can feel the rush
Watching you become everything I'm not
You've been holding back for so long
Time to grow up
Come into your own
Aim for the moon, no looking back
Sing it now
I made you this way
You have me to thank

I’ve had a little bit too much
Don’t wait for me
I’ll wake up on my own tomorrow
I took a little medicine love to lubricate my flow
Don’t wait up for me cuz I’ll be coming home tomorrow
Eagle vs Crows

Sick of being in my head and thinkin' about my fate
And worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing
And blow through all my wealth
I made some mistakes, not so good with planning
But I got some skills in easy living
Cut my ties with desperation and learned to live with a little sensation
Hey!
Just for the day, we’ll pretend I’m made of money
I’ll be your sugar daddy
Hey!
Let’s make a fool of ourselves and crash a party
Act like we own the place
Act like we own the place
Swinging back and forth,
All my faults are peaking past the surface
Is it worth it to fall back down?
We’re way too caught up in the race with time
It’s getting hard to take it in
We’re trying hard to be the first in line
Just wanna be a kid again, a kid again
Sick of being in my head and thinkin' about my fate
And worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing
And blow through all my wealth
I made some mistakes, not so good with planning
But I got some skills in easy living
Cut my ties with desperation and learned to live with a little sensation
Over, over, overwhelmed again
Singin' out, out
Bury it away
Killing all the flies
I’m not done swinging back and forth yet
Forgive me for what I will do

We lie cold
Dam up the river we can go slow
We don’t wanna know
Dull down our senses
Become numb
We take our time ignoring all the signs
Living in fear of our lies
Never bad enough to break it or good enough to feel right
Been in overtime half our lives
Under indecision, we become so dependent on the rush of the moment
Sanitize my head
Am I the reason that you can’t look past your future self?
Got me believing you been stuck and glued in frequent doubt
I know the feeling cuz I can’t keep my mind open now
Make up your mind
We’re running out of time
Doubt is failure by design
I’m burning up
Can only take so much
I know you can feel it, it’s catching up
It’s getting too heavy for both of us
We lie cold
Dam up the river, we can go slow
We don’t wanna know
Dull down our senses
Become numb

I am lost
Need a God
Somewhere to go when it’s all over
I am blind
Give me eyes
Kaleidoscope the world in color
Don’t have time to meditate the meaning of the rain
Synchronize our memories til we all think same way
'Cause I get lost
Need a God
Help me put my world in order
I don’t wanna know the truth
I just need feel secure again
Codify my wasted youth
So I don’t feel this meaningless again
Tickle my animal instincts, survive
Capable, sociable subject, I’m part of the pack
We crave a greater existence, survive
Attainable, modified purpose
I’m part of the pack
Citizen of the world
Oh no, he said a bad word
We should burn him at the stake
Desecrate his name
Spit on him from high horses
Exaggerate the shame
He’s ignorant and vulgar
So evil we can tell
He’ll surely rot in hell
A homophobic sociopath, a menace to us all
He’ll take the fall
The fall
